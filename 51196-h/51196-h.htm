<p>The student of history has need of divisions. By their aid
alone can he hope to have command of the facts and events
with which history in so large part deals. It is well therefore
to begin the study of any particular history by noting such
changes, such epoch-making events as may form partition walls
of boxes in which may be placed our classified information.</p>

<p>The history of Germany has been variously divided into
periods by the different authors. That which we have adopted
here has the sanction of the majority and will be found exceedingly
natural, and hence simple and convenient. The
student should memorize it thoroughly, being assured that
though a very <i>general</i> history of itself, nevertheless it is more
than many of supposed information could tell of the history of
this wonderful people.</p>

<h4>THE PRIMITIVE POPULATIONS OF GERMANY, THEIR ORIGIN,
CUSTOMS, RELIGION, ETC.</h4>

<p>“Germany, or Deutschland, occupies a large part of Central
Europe. Speaking roughly, it now reaches from the Alps to the
Baltic and the North Sea, and from the valleys of the Rhine
and the Maes to the Danube as far as the March and the Mur,
and to the Prosna and the Lower Niemen. The country is
mountainous in the south, hilly in the center, and flat in the
north, where it forms part of the great plain which takes in the
whole of north-eastern Europe. The western part of this plain
takes in the country between the Teutoburg Wood and the
North Sea. As it passes eastward it widens till it reaches from
the Erz and Riesen Mountains to the Baltic. A part of South
Germany slopes toward the east, and is watered by the Danube;
but the general slope of the country is toward the north. Among
the rivers flowing northward are the Rhine, the Ems, the Weser,
the Elbe, the Oder, and the Vistula.”—<i>Sime.</i></p>

<p>“Germany has varied very much in extent at different times.
This is due partly to the fact that it has no clearly-marked
natural boundaries on the east and west, but chiefly to the
peculiarity of its position. It is the central country of Europe.
Being surrounded by most of the leading nations of the Continent,
the Germans have been involved, more than any other
people, in the general history of Europe. Of all their neighbors,
the Scandinavians are most nearly allied to the Germans. Both
are branches of the Teutonic race. But the Germans are also
connected, although not so closely, with the other surrounding
peoples. All, if we except the Magyars or Hungarians, who
are Turanians, belong to the great Aryan family.”—<i>Sime.</i></p>

<p>“Ancient authors mention several German tribes, as well as
their dwelling places, with greater or less precision. Several
of them also speak of the chief tribes, among which the single
septs united themselves. But their statements are not sufficiently
unanimous or precise to give us that clear view which we would
so willingly obtain. The origin of the Germanic nations, therefore,
like that of all others, is uncertain. To assign to them a
distinct historical origin is to make an assertion without evidence,
though it is now indisputably established that the Teutonic
dialects belong to one great family with the Latin,
the Greek, the Sanscrit, and other European and Asiatic
tongues. All the positive knowledge that we have of the German
nations, previous to their contact with the Romans, is
exceedingly vague and mere conjecture.”—<i>Menzies.</i></p>

<p>“The Romans first heard the name ‘Germans’ from the
Celtic Gauls, in whose language it meant simply <i>neighbors</i>.
The first notice of a Germanic tribe was given to the world by
the Greek navigator Pytheas, who made a voyage to the Baltic
in the year 330 B. C. Beyond the amber coast, eastward of the
mouth of the Vistula, he found the Goths, of whom we hear
nothing more until they appear, several centuries later, on the
northern shore of the Black Sea. For more than two hundred
years there is no further mention of the Germanic races; then,
most unexpectedly, the Romans were called upon to make their
personal acquaintance.”—<i>Bayard Taylor.</i></p>

<p>“At the time of their first contact with the Romans, these
Germanic tribes had lost even the tradition of their Asiatic
origin. They supposed themselves to have originated upon the
soil where they dwelt, sprung either from the earth or descended
from the gods. According to the most popular legend, the
war-god Tuisko, or Tiu, had a son, Mannus (whence the word
<i>man</i> is derived), who was the first human parent of the German
race. Many centuries must have elapsed since their first settlement
in Europe, or they could not have so completely changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the forms of their religion and their traditional history.”—<i>Taylor.</i></p>


<h4>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</h4>

<p>“The early Germans were noted for their love of feasting,
which was carried to such excess that they would sometimes
spend whole days and nights at table, drinking and gaming, in
consequence of which they often quarreled and fought so that
a convivial meeting frequently terminated in bloodshed. They
gambled with dice, as Tacitus, with astonishment, informs us,
in a sober state and as a serious occupation, and with so much
eagerness for gain, that when they had lost all they hazarded
their freedom, and even their very persons, upon the last cast.
The loser freely delivered himself up to slavery, although even
younger and stronger than his adversary, and patiently allowed
himself to be bound and sold as a slave; thus steadfastly did
they keep their word, even in a bad case. ‘They call this good
faith,’ says the Roman writer. There were various circumstances
under which a German might forfeit his liberty, such as
marrying a bondwoman, or of not being able to pay his debts;
but the generality of the slaves were captives taken in war.</p>

<p>“The Germans did not all sit down at the same table, but each
man had his own seat and board, which were of a very rough
description, being merely a wooden stool and table, furnished
with drinking horns, wooden bowls, spoons, and platters. Each
person of rank had his servant behind him to hold his shield
and spear. He kept his sword by his side, for on no occasion
would a German part with his arms, which was a proof that he
expected to have frequent need of them.</p>

<p>“The wives and daughters of the Germans, we are told, shared
in all the public entertainments, for however rude and fierce
these people might be in other respects, they were distinguished,
even in the most barbarous ages, for their attention and respect
to the female sex, whom they consulted on the most important
affairs, and by whose opinions they were very often guided.
The feasts of the Germans, like those of the Gauls and Scandinavians,
were always attended by a number of bards, several
of whom were attached to the family of every chief, and were
treated with the highest respect. They played on the harp and
flute, and when they sang of war, the company took part in the
concert by clashing their swords against their shields.</p>

<p>“The Germans, in very remote ages, were dressed in skins of
wild animals, and afterward in a coarse kind of linen, made by
the women; but as they intermixed more with the Gauls, they
learned from them to make a finer sort of linen, and woolen
also, and as soon as they were acquainted with these useful
arts, spinning and weaving became the principal occupations
of German women, and a more civilized costume was adopted
than that which was made from the skins of the elk and reindeer.
These animals, in the time of Julius Cæsar, were very
numerous in the forests of Germany, from which, however, they
have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>“The Romans justly considered the German nation as an aboriginal,
pure, and unmixed race of people. They resembled
themselves alone; and like the specifically similar plants of the
field, which, springing from a pure seed, not raised in the hot-bed
of a garden, but germinating in the healthy, free, unsheltered
soil, do not differ from each other by varieties; so, also,
among the thousands of the simple German race, there was but
one determined and equal form of body. Their chest was wide
and strong; their hair yellow, and with young children it was of
a dazzling white. Their skin was also white, their eyes blue,
and their glance bold and piercing. Their powerful gigantic
bodies, which the Romans and Gauls could not behold without
fear, displayed the strength that nature had given to this people;
for, according to the testimony of some of the ancient
writers, their usual height was seven feet. From their earliest
youth upward they hardened their bodies by all devisable
means. New-born infants were dipped in cold water, and the
cold bath was continued during their whole lives as the strengthening
renovator, by both boys and girls, men and women. The
children ran about almost naked, and effeminate nations wondered
how those of the Germans, without cradles or swaddling
bands, should grow up to the very fullest bloom of health.</p>

<p>“Cæsar, Tacitus, and Suetonius, with many others, have pointed
to one and the same characteristic of the Germans, as the secret
of their power and prosperity. The Kelt had everywhere
yielded to the eagles of Rome, while the Teuton everywhere
checked their flight. Amazed, and even alarmed, at those tall
fair-haired, blue-eyed enemies, who had to be conquered with
gold instead of steel, Tacitus examines the reasons of their
prowess, and finds it in the soberness of their blood, in their
reverence for women and for the laws of nature, in their deference
to parental authority and their marriages of maturity.
‘Chastity is a custom with them,’ says the ‘De Moribus Germanorum,’
and a passage to the same effect might be cited
from Cæsar. Those southern soldiers and statesmen saw, in
truth, with a terrible sense of overhanging fate, that race of
hardy, chaste, home-loving, free and fearless barbarians, of
whom the Emperor Titus said, ‘Their bodies are great, but their
souls are greater.’ The tone of Tacitus is that of a man who
bitterly feels how much greater, after all, as a moral being, the
barbarian may be than the civilized man, when civilization recognizes
no higher aim than material splendor, and that utility
which subserves material wants. Other civilizations than that
of the Empire may read a lesson in those brief pages where the
philosopher of a worn-out world records his impression of the
races from which the world was hereafter to be reconstituted.”—<i>Menzies.</i></p>

<p>“The three principal vices of the Germans were indolence,
drunkenness, and love of gaming. Although always ready for
the toils and dangers of war, they disliked to work at home.
The women ruled and regulated their households with undisputed
sway. They were considered the equals of the men, and
exhibited no less energy and courage. They were supposed to
possess the gift of prophecy, and always accompanied the men
to battle, where they took care of the wounded, and stimulated
the warriors by their shouts and songs. They honored the institution
of marriage to an extent beyond that exhibited by any
other people of the ancient world. Those who proved unfaithful
to the marriage vow were punished with death.”—<i>Taylor.</i></p>


<h4>RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND USAGES.</h4>

<p>“The worship of the ancient Germans coincided with their
natural character, and consequently was much more simple and
elevated than that of other peoples. Although uncultivated,
they carried in their hearts the sentiment of an infinite and
eternal power, and they regarded it as an affront to the divinity
to enclose it within walls, or to represent it under human form.
They consecrated to it the woods and forests as a spacious temple
of which nature itself erected the pillars, and to which the
immensity of the heavens formed the roof.</p>

<p>“The ancient Germans adored, like the Persians, the sun and
fire, but they regarded Wodan as their supreme god. They
called him also Alvater, father of all things. Their most beneficent
goddess was the mother of the earth (Hertha). The Germans
attached great importance to divinations and prognostics.
The crow and the owl signified misfortune; the cuckoo announced
long life. They discovered the future by means of the
branches of fruit trees (runes). Various signs were cut upon
each rod, and afterwards the rods were thrown upon a white
cloth; then the priest, or father of the family, offered up a prayer
to the divinity, and thrice chose from among the rods those
which were to give the divine revelations. The clairvoyants
were held in high estimation, and history has preserved some
of the names of those to which the belief of the people had
given a great influence over the decision of public affairs.”—<i>Menzies.</i></p>

<p>“The people had their religious festivals at stated seasons,
when sacrifices—sometimes of human beings—were laid upon
the altars of the gods in the sacred groves. Even after they
became Christians, in the eighth century, they retained their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
habit of celebrating some of these festivals, but changed them
into the Christian anniversaries of Christmas, Easter, and
Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>“Thus, from all we can learn respecting them, we may say
that the Germans, during the first century before Christ, were
fully prepared by their habits, laws, and their moral development,
for a higher civilization. They were still restless, after
so many centuries of wandering; they were fierce and fond of
war, as a natural consequence of their struggles with the neighboring
races; but they had already acquired a love for the wild
land where they dwelt, they had begun to cultivate the soil, they
had purified and hallowed the family relation, which is the
basis of all good government, and finally, although slavery
existed among them, they had established equal rights for free
men.</p>

<p>“If the object of Rome had been civilization, instead of conquest
and plunder, the development of the Germans might
have commenced much earlier and produced very different
results.”—<i>Taylor.</i></p>

<p>I.—THE AIR.</p>

<p>When we begin to look attentively at the world around us,
one of the first things to set us thinking is the air. We do not
see it, and yet it is present wherever we may go. What is this
air?</p>

<p>Although invisible, it is yet a real, material substance. When
you swing your arm rapidly up and down you feel the air offering
a resistance to the hand. The air is something which you
can feel, though you can not see it. You breathe it every moment.
You can not get away from it, for it completely surrounds
the earth. To this outer envelope of air, the name of
<i>atmosphere</i> is given.</p>

<p>The air is not a simple substance, but a mixture of two invisible
gases, called nitrogen and oxygen. But besides these chief
ingredients, it contains also small quantities of other substances;
some of which are visible, others invisible. If you close the
shutters of a room, and let the sunlight stream through only
one chink or hole into the room, you see some of the visible
particles of the air. Hundreds of little motes, or specks of
dust, cross the beam of light which makes them visible against
the surrounding darkness, though they disappear in full daylight.
But it is the invisible parts of the air which are of chief importance;
and among them there are two which you must especially
remember—the vapor of water and carbonic acid gas.
You will soon come to see why it is needful for you to distinguish
these.</p>

<p>Now what is this vapor of water? You will understand its
nature if you watch what takes place when a kettle boils. From
the mouth of the spout a stream of white cloud comes out into
the air. It is in continual motion; its outer parts somehow or
other disappear, but as fast as they do so they are supplied
by fresh materials from the kettle. The water in the kettle is
all the while growing less, until at last, if you do not replenish
it, the whole will be boiled away, and the kettle left quite dry.
What has become of all the water? You have changed it into
vapor. It is not destroyed or lost in any way, it has only passed
from one state into another, from the liquid into the gaseous
form, and is now dissolved in the air.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas is also one of the invisible substances of
the atmosphere, of which, though it forms no more than four
parts in every ten thousand, yet it constitutes an important
ingredient. You will understand how important it is when you
are told that, from this carbonic acid in the air, all the plants
which you see growing upon the land extract nearly the whole
of their solid substance. When a plant dies and decays, the
carbonic acid is restored to the air again. On the other hand,
plants are largely eaten by animals, and help to form the
framework of their bodies. Animals in breathing give out
carbonic acid gas; and when they die, and their bodies decay,
the same substance is again restored to the atmosphere.
Hence the carbonic acid of the air is used to build up the
structure both of plants and animals, and is given back again
when these living things cease to live. There is a continual
coming and going of this material between the air and the
animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>

<p>You know that though you can not see the air you can feel it
when it moves. A light breeze, or a strong gale, can be just as
little seen by the eye as still air; and yet we readily feel their
motion. But even when the air is still it can make itself sensible
in another way, viz: by its temperature. For air, like common
visible things, can be warmed and cooled.</p>

<p>This warming and cooling of the air is well illustrated by
what takes place in a dwelling-house. If you pass out of a
warm room, on a winter’s day, into the open air when there is
no wind, you feel a sensation of cold. Whence does this sensation
come? Not from anything you can see, for your feet,
though resting on the frozen ground, are protected by leather,
and do not yet feel the cold. It is the air which is cold, and
which encircles you on all sides, and robs you of your heat;
while at the same time you are giving off or radiating heat from
your skin into the air. On the other hand, if, after standing a
while in the chilly winter air, you return into the room again,
you feel a sensation of pleasant warmth. Here, again, the
feeling does not come from any visible object, but from the
invisible air which touches every part of your skin, and is thus
robbed of its heat by you.</p>

<p>Now, how is it that the atmosphere should sometimes be warm
and sometimes cold? Where does the heat come from? and
how does the air take it up?</p>

<p>Let us return again to the illustration of the house. In
winter, when the air is keen and frosty outside, it is warm and
pleasant indoors, because fires are there kept burning. The
burning of coal and wood produces heat, and the heat thus
given out warms the air. Hence it is by the giving off or radiation
of the heat from some burning substance that the air of
our houses is made warmer than the air outside.</p>

<p>Now, it is really by radiation from a heated body that the air
outside gets its heat. In summer, this air is sometimes far
hotter than is usual in dwelling-houses in winter. All this heat
comes from the sun, which is an enormous hot mass, continually
sending out heat in all directions.</p>

<p>But, if the sun is always pouring down heat upon the earth,
why is the air ever cold? Place a screen between you and a
bright fire, and you will immediately feel that some of the heat
from the fire place has been cut off. When the sun is shining,
expose your hand to its beams for a time, and then hold a book
between the hand and the sun. At first, your skin is warmed;
but the moment you put it in the shade, it is cooled again. The
book has cut off the heat which was passing directly from the
sun to your hand. When the atmosphere is felt to be cold,
something has come in the way to keep the sun’s heat from
directly reaching us.</p>

<p>Clouds cut off the direct heat of the sun. You must often
have noticed the change of temperature, when, after the sun
has been shining for a time, a cloud comes between it and the
earth. Immediately a feeling of chilliness is experienced, which
passes off as soon as the cloud has sailed on, and allowed the
sun once more to come out.</p>

<p>The air itself absorbs some of the sun’s heat, and the greater
the thickness of air through which that heat has to make its
way, the more heat will be absorbed. Besides this, the more
the rays of heat are slanted the weaker do they become. At
noon, for example, the sun stands high in the sky. Its rays are
then nearest to the vertical, and have also the least thickness
of air to pass through before they reach us. As it descends in
the afternoon, its rays get more and more slanted, and must
also make their way through a constantly increasing thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of air. Hence the middle of the day is much warmer than
morning or evening.</p>

<p>At night, when the sun no longer shines, its heat does not
directly warm the part of the earth in shadow. That part not only
receives no heat from it, but even radiates its heat out into the
cold sky. Hence night is much colder than day.</p>

<p>Then, again, in summer the sun at noon shines much higher
in the sky with us, or more directly overhead, than in winter.
Its heat comes down less obliquely and has less depth of air to
pass through, and hence is much more felt than in winter, when,
as you know, the sun in our part of the world never rises high
even at mid-day.</p>

<p>If we were dependent for our warmth upon the direct heat of
the sun alone, we should be warm only when the sun shines.
A cloudy day would be an extremely cold one, and every night
as intensely frosty as it ever is in winter. Yet such is not the
case. Cloudy days are often quite warm; while we are all
aware that the nights are by no means always very cold. There
must be some way in which the sun’s heat is stored up, so that
it can be felt even when he is not shining.</p>

<p>In summer the ground gets warmed; in some parts, indeed, becoming
even so hot at times that we can hardly keep the hand
upon it. In hot countries this is felt much more than in this
country. Soil and stones absorb heat steadily, that is to say,
soon get heated, and they soon cool again. When they have
been warmed by the sun, the air gets warmed by contact with
them, and keeps its heat longer than they do; so that even
when at night the soil and stones have become ice-cold, the air
a little above is not so chilly. On the other hand, when the
surface of the ground is cold, it cools the air next it. The
ground parts easily with its heat, and a vast amount of heat is
in this way radiated at night from the earth outward into the
cold starry space. Much more heat, however, would be lost
from this cause did not the abundant aqueous vapor of the atmosphere
absorb part of it, and act as a kind of screen to
retard the radiation. This is the reason why in hot climates,
where the air is very dry—that is, contains a small proportion
of the vapor of water—the nights are relatively colder than they
are in other countries where the air is moister. In like manner,
clouds serve to keep heat from escaping; and hence it is that
cloudy nights are not so cold as those which are clear and
starry.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, then, is heated or cooled according as it lies
upon a warm or cold part of the earth’s surface; and, by means
of its aqueous vapor, it serves to store up and distribute this
heat, keeping the earth from such extremes of climate as would
otherwise prevail.</p>

<p>The air lying next to a hot surface is heated; the air touching
a cold surface is cooled. And upon such differences of temperature
in the air the formation of winds depends.</p>

<p>Hot or warm air is lighter than cold air. You have learned
how heat expands bodies. It is this expansion of air, or the
separation of its particles further from each other which makes
it less dense or heavy than cold air, where the particles lie more
closely together. As a consequence of this difference of density,
the light warm air rises, and the heavy cold air sinks.
You can easily satisfy yourselves of this by experiment. Take
a poker, and heat the end of it in the fire until it is red-hot.
Withdraw it, and gently bring some small bits of very light
paper, or some other light substance, a few inches above the
heated surface. The bits of paper will be at once carried up
into the air. This happens because the air, heated by the
poker, immediately rises, and its place is taken by colder air,
which, on getting warmed, likewise ascends. The upward
currents of air grow feebler as the iron cools, until, when it is
of the same temperature as the air around, they cease.</p>

<p>This is the principle on which our fire-places are constructed.
The fire is not kindled on the hearth, for, in that case, it would
not get a large enough draft of air underneath, and would be
apt to go out. It is placed some way above the floor, and a
chimney is put over it. As soon as the fire is lighted, the air
next it gets warmed, and begins to mount, and the air in the
room is drawn in from below to take the place of that which
rises. All the air which lies above the burning coal gets warmer
and lighter; it therefore flows up the chimney, carrying with it
the smoke and gases. You will understand that though a bright
blazing fire is a pleasant sight in winter, we do not get all the
heat which it gives out. On the contrary, a great deal of the
heat goes up the chimney; and, except in so far as it warms the
walls, passes away and warms the outer air.</p>

<p>What happens in a small way in our houses takes place on a
far grander scale in nature. As already pointed out, the sun is
the great source of heat which warms and lightens our globe.
While the heat of the sun is passing through the air, it does
very little in the way of warming it. The heat goes through
the air, and warms the surface of the earth. You know that in
summer the direct rays of the sun are hot enough to burn your
face, and yet, if you put even a thin sheet of paper over your
head, enough to cut off these rays, the sensation of burning
heat at once goes off, although the same air is playing about you
all the time.</p>

<p>Both land and water are heated by the sun’s rays, and the
same change in the air then takes place which we find also at
our firesides. The layer of air next the warmed earth becomes
itself warmed. As it thereby grows lighter it ascends, and its
place is taken by colder air, which flows in from the neighborhood
to take its place. This flowing in of air is wind.</p>

<p>One of the most important ingredients in the air is the vapor
of water. Let us try to see, first of all, how it gets into and out
of the air. And in this case, as before, you will find that great
questions in science often admit of being simply and readily
illustrated by the most familiar things.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that on very cold nights the windows
of sitting-rooms, or crowded public halls, are apt to be found
streaming with water on the inside.</p>

<p>Now, in such cases, where does the moisture come from?
Certainly not out of the glass. It is derived from the vapor of
water present in the air. This word vapor is often used to describe
some kind of visible mist or fog. But these visible forms
of moisture are not properly vapor in the sense in which the
term is used in science. The aqueous vapor of the air is always
invisible, even when the air is saturated with it, and only when
it passes back into the state of water do you actually see anything.</p>

<p>When the invisible vapor dissolved in the air becomes visible,
as in mists, clouds, dew, or rain, it is said to be condensed, and
this process of liquefaction is called condensation.</p>

<p>The quantity of vapor which the air can contain varies according
to temperature, warm air being able to hold more than
cold air.</p>

<p>As the air is cooled, its power of retaining vapor diminishes.
When it becomes colder than the temperature at which it is able
to keep its supply of vapor dissolved, the excess of vapor is
condensed and becomes visible. The temperature at which
this takes place is the point of saturation, or dew-point.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may ask how it is that the vapor so universally
present gets into the atmosphere, and where it comes from. If
you pour a little water into a plate, and set it down in the open
air, you will note in the course of a day or two, that the water
has sensibly diminished. The air has drunk up part of it, and
will drink up the whole, if the water is allowed to stand long
enough. What takes place from a small quantity of water goes
on from every surface of water on the face of the earth, from
every brook and river and lake, and from the great sea itself.
Water is constantly passing off into vapor, which is received
and retained by the air. This process is called evaporation,
and the water which passes off into vapor is said to evaporate.</p>

<p>Since warm air can hold more vapor than cold air, evaporation
must be more vigorous in sunshine than at night, and
during summer than during winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>On a dry, bracing day, evaporation goes on rapidly, because
the air has not nearly got all the quantity of vapor it can hold
in solution. On a damp day, however, when the air contains
about as much vapor as it can hold at that particular temperature,
evaporation is quite feeble, or ceases altogether. This
varying capacity of the air for vapor is the reason why laundresses
find so much difference between days, in the ease with
which they can have their clothes dried.</p>

<p>After sunset, when the sky is clear, you know that the grass
gets wet with dew. In the morning you may see mists hanging
over woods, and streams, and hills, and gradually melting away
as the sun mounts in the sky. At all times of the year you may
watch how clouds form and dissolve, and form again, ever
changing their size and shape as they move through the air.
Now these are all examples of the condensation of vapor. Let
us see how the process takes place.</p>

<p>Condensation, as we have seen, results from a cooling of the
air. When vapor is condensed, it does not at once take the
form of running water. The cold glass brought into the warm
room has first a fine film of mist formed upon it, and then by
degrees the clear drops of water come. In reality mist is made
up of exceedingly minute particles of water, and it is the running
together of these which makes the larger drops. So in
nature on the great scale, when condensation occurs the vapor
first appears as a fine mist. This is always the result of cooling;
so that, whenever you see a mist or cloud forming, you
may conclude that the air in which it lies is being cooled.</p>

<p>Dew is the name given to the wetness which we notice appearing
in the evening, or at night, upon grass, leaves, or stones,
or even sometimes on our hair. In the morning you have, no
doubt, often watched the little dewdrops sparkling upon the
foliage and the delicate threads of gossamer. Now this wetness
does not come out of the leaves or stones, nor out of your hair.
It is all derived from the air by condensation, exactly as we see
the film of mist form upon the cold tumbler in the warm moist
air of a room. In fact, that film of mist was really dew, and all
dew is formed in the same way, and from the same cause.</p>

<p>At night, when the sky is clear, the earth radiates heat rapidly;
that is to say, it gives off into cold space a great part of
the heat which it has received from the sun during the day. Its
surface consequently becomes cold, as you may have felt when
you put your hand upon leaves or stones after nightfall. The
layer of air next the cooled ground is chilled below its point of
condensation, and the excess of vapor is deposited as dew upon
the grass, twigs, stones, and other objects. Hence it is that the
temperature at which this condensation begins to take place is
called the dew-point.</p>

<p>Another way in which a cold surface of the earth may produce
condensation is shown by what takes place among mountains.
When a warm moist wind blows upon a chill mountain
top, the air is cooled, and its vapor becomes visible in the form
of a mist or cloud. You can often see that the cloud is quite
solitary, and even shapes itself to the form of the ground, as if
it were a sort of fleecy cap drawn down over the mountain’s
head. This is often well marked in the morning. As day advances,
the ground, warmed by the sun, no longer cools the
air, and hence the mist is gradually re-absorbed into the atmosphere.
But by and by, at the coming on of night, when the
ground is once more cooled by radiation, if there should be
vapor enough in the air, the mist will re-form, and the mountain
put on his cap again.</p>

<p>Cold air, as well as cold ground, condenses the vapor of
warmer air. If you watch what goes on along the course of a
river, you will often see examples of this kind of condensation.
The ground on either side of the river parts with its heat after
sundown sooner than the river itself does, and consequently
cools the air above it more than the air above the river is cooled.
So when this colder air from either side moves over to take the
place of the warmer damp air lying on and rising from the river,
condensation ensues in the form of the mist or river-fog, which
so commonly hangs at night and early morning over streams.</p>

<p>A cloud is merely a mist formed by the cooling of warm moist
air, when it loses its heat from any cause, such as expansion
during ascent, or contact with currents of cooler air. If you
watch what goes on in the sky, you may often see clouds in
the act of forming. At first a little flake of white appears. By
degrees this grows larger, and other cloudlets arise and flock
together, until at last the sky is quite overcast with heavy clouds,
and rain begins to fall. The vapor which is thus condensed in
the air has all been obtained by the evaporation of the water on
the earth’s surface. It rises with the warm air, which losing its
heat as it ascends, and coming too in contact with colder layers
of the atmosphere, can not hold all its vapor, and is obliged to
get rid of the excess, which then condenses into cloud.</p>

<p>On a summer morning the sky is often free from cloud. As
the day advances, and the earth gets warmed, more vapor is
raised; and as this vapor, borne upward by the ascending air-currents,
reaches the higher and colder parts of the atmosphere,
it is chilled into the white fleecy clouds which you see forming
about mid-day and in the afternoon. Toward evening, when
less evaporation takes place, the clouds cease to grow, and
gradually lessen in size until at night the sky is quite clear.
They have been dissolved again by descending and coming in
contact with the warm air nearest to the earth. Again, you
have often noticed that clouds move across the sky. They are
driven along by upper currents of air, and of course the stronger
these currents are the faster do the clouds travel. In this way
the sky is sometimes completely overcast with clouds which
have come from a distance.</p>

<p>You are well aware that rain always comes from clouds in the
sky. When the sky is clear overhead, no rain falls. Only when
it gets overcast does the rain come. You can watch a dark
rain-cloud gather itself together and discharge a heavy shower
upon the earth. When a cold glass is brought into a warm
room, you will remember that the film of mist formed upon the
glass is found by degrees to gather into drops, and trickles
down the cold surface. Now the mist on the glass and the cloud
in the sky are both formed of minute particles of water, separated
by air. It is the running together of these particles which
gives rise to these drops. In the one case, the drops run down
the cold glass. In the other case, they fall as drops of rain
through the air. Rain, therefore, is thus a further stage in the
condensation of the aqueous vapor of the atmosphere. The
minute particles of the cloud, as condensation proceeds, gather
more moisture round them, until at last they form drops of
water, too heavy to hang any longer suspended in the air. These
then fall to the earth as rain-drops.</p>

<p>But there is another important form in which the moisture of
the clouds may descend to the surface of the earth. When the
weather is cold enough, there fall to the ground not drops of
rain, but flakes of snow.</p>

<p>If you bring snow indoors, it soon melts into water. If you expose
this water for a time it evaporates. Snow, water, and aqueous
vapor are thus only different forms of the same substance. We
say that water can exist in three forms—the gaseous, the liquid,
and the solid. Snow is an example of the solid condition.</p>

<p>On a frosty night pools of water are covered with a hard,
transparent crust, of what is called ice. You may break this
crust into pieces, but if the cold continues, a new crust will soon
be formed with bits of the old one firmly cemented in it. And
the greater the cold the thicker will the crust be, until perhaps
the whole of the water in the pools may become solid. If you
take a piece of this solid substance, you find it to be cold, brittle,
and transparent. Brought into a warm room it soon melts
into water, and you may drive off the water as before into vapor.
Ice is the general name given to water when it is in the solid
state, such forms as snow and hail being only different appearances
which ice puts on. Whenever water becomes colder than
a certain temperature it passes into ice, or freezes, and this
temperature is consequently known as the freezing-point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper layers of the atmosphere are much colder than
the freezing-point of water. In the condensation which takes
place there, the clouds do not resolve themselves into rain. The
vapor of the up-streaming currents of warm air from the earth’s
surface is condensed and frozen in these high regions, and
passes into little crystals, which unite into flakes of snow. Even
in summer the fine white cloudlets which you see floating at
great heights are probably formed of snow. But in those countries,
such as ours, where in winter the air even at the surface is
sometimes very cold, the snow falls to the ground, and lies there
as a white covering, until returning warmth melts it away.</p>

<p>Besides rain and snow, the moisture of the air takes sometimes
the form of hail, which consists of little lumps of ice like
frozen rain; and of sleet, which is partially melted snow. But
rain and snow are the most important, and it is these two forms
which we must follow a little further.</p>

<p>Before doing so, let us gather together the sum of what has
been said about the aqueous vapor of the air. We have learned
that, as every sheet of water on the face of the globe evaporates,
the air is full of vapor; that this vapor is condensed into visible
form, and appears as dew, mist, and cloud. We have learned
further, that the vapor of which clouds are formed is resolved
into rain and snow, and, in one or other of these forms, descends
to the earth again. There is thus a circulation of water
between the solid earth beneath and the air above. This circulation
is as essential to the earth in making it a fit habitation for
living things, as the circulation of blood is in keeping our bodies
alive. It mixes and washes the air, clearing away impurities,
such as those which rise from the chimneys of a town. It moistens
and quickens the soil, which it renders capable of supporting
vegetation. It supplies springs, brooks, and rivers. In
short, it is the very mainspring of all the life of the globe. So
important a part of the machinery of the world deserves our
careful consideration. Let us next attend, therefore, to what
becomes of the rain and the snow after they have been discharged
from the air upon the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>“Let no one, upon a weak conceit of sobriety or an ill-applied
moderation, think or maintain that a man can search too far,
or be too well studied in the book of God’s word, or in the book
of God’s works—divinity or philosophy—but rather let men
endeavor an endless progress or proficiency in both; only let
them beware that they apply both to charity and not to arrogance;
to use, and not to ostentation; and again, that they do
not mingle or confound these learnings together.”—<i>Bacon.</i></p></div>

<p>Many have lost their early faith in the Bible and are following
its guidance with faltering footstep. Between them and
hitherto accepted truths the sciences have been placing apparently
insurmountable obstacles. The trustful simplicity with
which they once read the sacred record has almost perished.
Inferences by the man of science, conflicting with the interpretations
of scripture by the theologian, have rudely shaken their
most cherished convictions. They are not infidels, they are
not skeptics, for doubt is distasteful to them, they long for more
definite expositions and a firmer faith.</p>

<p>Such, possibly, may be some of you. In the midst of such
discussions as are at present in progress, perplexity is not unnatural.
Your most anxiously sustained investigations have
hitherto only multiplied difficulties, and a sense of responsibility
alone constrains you to linger over conclusions from which
your judgment recoils. This hesitancy of belief may be at the
outset disheartening; yet it may be inseparable from that clearness
of insight and that force of character which, in the end,
commonly create the stablest convictions, and evoke adequate
proof to shield them. To shun or to denounce you because you
can not acquiesce in what we believe is inconsistent, not only
with the lessons of philosophy, but with his example to “bear
witness to the truth.”</p>

<p>What is your duty, with the natural sciences on the one hand,
appealing so largely to your reason, and the scriptures on the
other hand, appealing so constantly to your faith? Obviously,
to depreciate neither, but to welcome both the sciences and the
scriptures, to ascertain their harmony, to note their differences,
and to accept all the treasures of truth which they may bring.
Indifference is inexcusable as is excessive zeal, and apathy as
antagonism.</p>

<p>The Bible, free to us as are the fields of science, challenges
the severest scrutiny. It is the boldest of books, and demands
the application of every test. As it is the most comprehensive
history in the world, and gives amplest scope for research; as
its earliest records are the oldest in existence, and its latest
prophecies shed light far into the future; as it touches depths
and reaches heights which no other book can approach; as it
brings into closest connection the visible and invisible, natural
law and supernatural force, the condition of man and the character
of God, it is exposed to assaults which no other book can
bear.</p>

<p>Systematic and persistent study is required at your hand, that
you may estimate aright not only the facts and arguments
brought against the Bible, but those also which are adduced in
its favor. The task may be arduous, but this price is not too
great for the settlement of questions so momentous; and if the
solution of some of them may have to be for a season postponed,
yours will be the satisfaction which the conscientious
improvement of every opportunity invariably fosters.</p>

<p>Different lines of investigation may be profitably followed,
but we may suggest the following as exhaustive, or nearly exhaustive,
of the most prominent questions which modern research
has raised.</p>

<p>As the Bible is confessedly related to the natural sciences,
archæology, history, and modern civilization, let it be placed
successively in the midst of their facts, and let us see to what
extent its statements can bear their light.</p>

<p>There are many questions which none of us can honestly
avoid; and while some may remain unsettled, the unbiased
review of those solutions which have been already offered, and
which have been generally accepted, will be found to confirm
scripture instead of confuting it.</p>

<p>1. As to science. Have astronomy and geology given evidence
for or against the eternity of the visible universe?
Has biology determined the origin of life? Whence it is?
Have comparative anatomy and physiology, psychology and
ethics, established more than one origin for the human race?
Are the incidental allusions in scripture contradicted or confirmed
in natural science?</p>

<p>2. As to archæology. Can the Bible confront prehistoric
revelations? Antiquity is pouring over the oldest records, increasing
light. Ruins, monuments, inscriptions, parchments,
have been emitting their wondrous testimonies, parallel with
scripture histories. Assyria, Egypt, Palestine, Greece, Rome,
in their histories, revolutions, and domestic episodes, have all
been interwoven with the statements of scripture as with those
of no other book. To what purpose has historic criticism dealt
with the sacred page? Is the Bible yielding or is it growing
brighter in the crucible of archæology?</p>

<p>3. As to modern history and civilization. By its claim to
uplift and bless the human race, the Bible is separated from all
other books. It proposes to revolutionize man’s moral history
here, and to prepare him for a future whose course it in part
delineates. Has it failed, or is it failing? Has it been enfeebled
by the lapse of ages? Has it become effete amid changes which
have given intellect new instruments and reason new spheres?
Has it lost its former hold of the human mind, and is it sinking
amid the tumult of bitterly conflicting opinions? Has ever tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
been found which it could not raise and enlighten? Or has
ever civilization outshone, in any land, its intellectual and
moral splendor?</p>

<p>4. As to the supernatural. If the Bible is the book which it
professes to be, and which we hold it is, the ordinary and the
extraordinary, the natural and the supernatural, must be associated
in its character and history. What is the warrant which
men of science adduce for repudiating the supernatural while
they accept the natural? And by what reason does the Christian
apologist attempt to preserve their connection? Is there no
evidence around us in the contrasts of barbarism and civilization,
as well as in the histories of nations, in their relation to
prophecy? And are there no facts in the strangely revolutionized
lives of thousands in the Christian church, which proclaim
the singular moral force of the word of God?</p>

<p>Assuming that you are willing to follow such a course of study
as we have sketched, either to remove doubts which may be
lingering in your own mind, or to aid some brother in his struggle
to win the repose which you have gained, we shall, at the
outset, offer some suggestions as to the spirit and the method
by which your work should be characterized. It is of much
importance to know, what is, and what is not, within our reach.</p>

<p>1. Do not assume the possibility, in the present state of our
knowledge, of demonstrating a perfect agreement between
science and scripture, or rather between the inferences of the
philosopher and the interpretations of the theologian. Much
remains to be ascertained before that result can be realized.
The natural sciences are confessedly incomplete; some of them
are only in their infancy, and can teach us little. Many years
may pass before they can be brought into perfect accord with
the Bible. As the facts of natural science have not been all
ascertained and classified, as its laws have not been all recognized,
and as the inferences of to-day may be modified by the
discoveries of to-morrow, it is absurd to be demanding immediate
evidence of a perfect agreement between science and
scripture. Apparent contradictions are, at the present stage
unavoidable. There must first be an exact and exhaustive examination
of all those points at which the scriptures and the
sciences touch each other; for so long as a single fact or a
single law remains unknown, some important or essential truth,
intimately related to the Bible, may be concealed. While the
natural sciences continue incomplete, natural theology must
necessarily have an imperfect foundation. As confessedly
dependent on what is incomplete, natural theology can have
neither the comprehensiveness nor the definiteness which characterizes
supernatural theology, as dependent on what is now
complete and unvarying. We can not force the legitimate yet
somewhat incoherent teachings of the one book—the works of
God—of which but a few leaves have been separated, scanned
and paged, into perfect harmony with the teachings of the other
book, whose revelation of truth has been finished, accredited,
and closed.</p>

<p>2. Wait patiently, while you work persistently, for the solution
of difficulties which may be continuing to press upon you.
The experience of the past is an encouragement for the future.
The sciences have again and again become their own interpreter,
and rejected erroneous inferences. Many examples might
be given, but one or two may in the meantime suffice. Human
skeletons were found in what seemed old limestone, on the
northeast coast of the mainland of Guadaloupe; and after bold
attacks on the Bible, which were met by some very weak and
irregular defenses, it was ascertained that the whole was a mistake,
that the limestone was of very recent formation, that the
skeletons were of well-known Indian tribes, and agitation
ceased. A similar commotion was raised when the supposed
imprints of human feet on limestone had been figured and described
in the <i>American Journal of Science;</i> and Christians
met strange infidel hypotheses by feeble assertions, until Dr.
Dale Owen proved the imprints to have been sculptured by an
Indian tribe. Thereafter, for a season, the scientific inquirer
and the theological student prosecuted their respective investigations
in peace. There are important lessons for us in these,
and in many similar facts. Christian apologists have often
egregiously erred, not only in hastily accepting statements as
to supposed facts, but in admitting the validity of the reasoning
which has been eagerly founded on them, and in making a
fruitless attempt to twist scripture into harmony with what science
itself has subsequently disowned. Facts ill observed, and
afterward misstated, have drawn many of our best and most
candid students into unnecessary collision with biblical critics;
and, after much heat in controversy, and the waste on both
sides of much intellectual energy, the obstacle lying between
them has unexpectedly vanished in the fuller light of science.
The evil to be deplored is, that after the errors have disappeared
their influence remains. The imprint often lingers after the
counterfeit die has been broken.</p>

<p>3. There is a constant tendency on the part of discoverers to
invest new facts with a fictitious interest, and those who are
hostile to the Bible eagerly parade them for the discomfiture of
Christians. Every fact is to be welcomed, but it is to be treasured
up only that it may be adjusted to other facts, and become
in part the foundation of a new truth. Isolated and unexplained
facts have been too often unceremoniously dragged in to give
testimony against some scripture statement, and have too easily
been held sufficient to push aside those accumulated evidences
to its truth, which history, or science, or both, had indisputably
established. It is not, indeed, surprising that the faith of many
young men has failed, when they have observed the too ready
acquiescence of prominent Christian writers in theories which
necessitate the abandonment of some of the impregnable fortresses
which have been raised by exact scholarship around
those portions of scripture which had longest been exposed to
the fiercest assaults. Were this method common, no permanent
foundation could be laid, and progress in any science
would be impossible. Is it not absurd to be displacing cornerstones,
and disowning, at random, first principles? No system
of philosophy, no science, not even mathematical, the exactest,
and in one sense the most permanent of all the sciences, could
have any weight or make the least progress if subjected to such
changes in both its principles and their applications, as have
marked the history of Bible assaults, concessions and defenses.
When facts, which are utterly inexplicable are presented, we
should retain the fact in science and also the relative statement
in scripture, assured that in due time the solution will come.</p>



<hr class="short" />
<h3><a name="October_21" id="October_21">[<i>October 21.</i>]</a></h3>


<p>4. Neither accept nor offer apologies for the Bible. It has, of
late, become common on the part of those who are alarmed by
the temporary triumphs which scientific investigation has given
to those who are avowedly hostile to the Bible, to demand that
its propositions be altogether disassociated from both science
and philosophy, on the plea that the Bible was not given to
teach either the one or the other. The proposal is plausible,
but it is really unnecessary, for although not given to teach
physical science, the Bible can not contradict either its facts or
its legitimate inferences. The word of God can not be regarded
as by any possibility contradicting the just lessons of his works.
Like every other book, the Bible must bear all the light that
can fall on its pages; and it must not only stand the tests of
criticism and history, but vindicate all its claims as the “more
sure word of prophecy.” Otherwise, appeals for leniency are
profitless. True, in its highest connections, the Bible is unapproachable
by other books; it is easily distinguishable from
them all; yet in its human relations it must submit to all the
ordinary appliances of scholarship. No apologies can justify
a single error in either its science or its history, and its propositions
are obviously inadmissable if they contradict human
reason; they may be above, but they can not be opposed to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Akin to an easy escape from difficulties, through apologies
for the Bible, is the tendency to glide into conclusions directly
hostile. The prevailing activity of the age is so unfavorable to
leisurely investigations as to facilitate the subtle advances of
error. While many writers of the present day are as preëminently
gifted, and as distinguished in the different departments
of learning, as those of any preceding age; and while
their reasonings and their conclusions are borne by the daily
and the serial press to every man’s door, multitudes think and
decide by substitute. They want leisure, and trust to others.
Rapidity of locomotion, the chief physical feature of our time,
betokens also its intellectual tendencies. Men read cursorily
and decide rapidly. The daily newspaper is making book-study
rarer than hitherto. It is felt in ten thousand instances
to be distasteful or difficult. The subtle influence of the daily
newspaper is telling on our thoughtfulness. We really seem to
be approaching the fulfillment of Lamartine’s prediction, “Before
this century shall have run out, journalism will be the
whole press, the whole of human thought. Thought will not
have had time to ripen, to accommodate itself into the form of
a book. The book will arrive too late; the only book possible
soon, will be a newspaper.”</p>

<p>As one result of this process, truth and error are often imperceptibly
mingled. So swift is the transition from one fact and
inference to another, that truth and error, like different colors
blent into one by rapid motion, become so much alike, that few
can separate them. Thus with every advance of truth, error is
wafted forward. The seeds of future tares and wheat are being
profusely scattered. It can not be denied, that while to almost
every man’s door are daily wafted accurate records of passing
history, of the discoveries of science, of the triumphs of art,
and of the generalizations of philosophy, the same messengers
no less sedulously exhibit, now faintly and now in the strongest
light, every difficulty connected with the Bible, both real and
imaginary, the boldest objections of historic criticism, the theories
of speculative philosophy, the apparent contradictions of
science and scripture, and the saddening conflicts of professing
Christians. The constant diffusion of such influences does tell
in the long run, not only on less active minds, but on the most
energetic, and it renders easier of acceptance every erroneous
conclusion.</p>

<p>But this incessant activity is a symptom of health. It augurs
good. Rightly directed, it may strengthen character while it
develops mental power, and gives a more exquisite appreciation
of the just and true. But remember that everything depends
on this rightness of direction; and to secure this, unfailing
caution is required. The wind and tide which, rightly used,
would hasten the voyager to his harbor, may, if unheeded,
strand him on an unexpected shore; and those subtle forces,
and those under-currents, which should have aided in guiding
us to a satisfying intellectual and moral repose, may, through
the thoughtlessness or the indolence that at the outset disregarded
a slight divergence from the truth, almost but not altogether
imperceptible, destroy our happiness through the shipwreck
and the ultimate abandonment of our Christian faith.</p>

<p>6. Another common tendency in the wrong direction claims
your attention. It manifests itself in repugnance to controversy
or discussion in every form. Many shrink from it as unseemly,
and seek escape in either solitude or study. While peace is in
itself desirable, it is not always attainable. You cannot escape
conflict by letting go the Bible; nor can you traverse any
fields of science without entanglement in the intellectual struggles
of disputants whose reasonings have sometimes but little
of the calmness of philosophy. Nor is this to be regretted.
The repose of meditation is not so bracing as the discipline of
occasional contest for the truth.</p>



<hr class="short" />
<h3><a name="October_28" id="October_28">[<i>October 28.</i>]</a></h3>


<p>There are other advantages. The attrition of discussion
often reveals and beautifies truths which would otherwise have
remained unrecognized. Apathy or silence may shelter error
without preserving truth. Intellectual indolence, bad for the
world, is still worse for the Church. The highest life is demanded
by the Bible, and, therefore, also the greatest activity.
From intellectual warfare, the sciences and the scriptures have
nothing to lose, but everything to gain. On Christian or skeptic,
on prophet true or false, the Bible never enforces silence.
It seals no thinker’s lip. “The prophet that hath a dream, let
him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak
my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the
Lord.” In the field of thought, nothing save the chaff perishes.
Lost truths spring up again; and, beneath their spreading
branches, vitiated reasoning, unsound criticism, and erroneous
conclusions, ultimately decay as briers beneath the spreading
oak.</p>

<p>There are those also who deplore discussion only because
it raises questions hostile to the scriptures, and alarms the
weak. This anxiety, though laudable, is fruitless. Vital questions
are already discussed on all hands, and in every variety
of aspect. There are disadvantages, but they are generally inseparable
from the progress of truth.</p>

<p>It will be admitted on both sides, that while the extension of
exact knowledge contracts the sphere of superstition, it enlarges
at the same time the sphere of skepticism. Superstition
may be displaced without Christianity becoming its substitute;
there may be a high and an attractive civilization, based on
science and its applications, which, in acknowledging the intellectual
and moral supremacy of the Bible, and nothing more,
may for a season destroy credulity, only to give fuller scope to
no-belief, and to evoke ultimately an opposition to the Bible
hitherto repressed or unknown. For such results we must be
prepared; they are collateral, not essential or direct. They
are, in fact, the price which we pay for our intellectual freedom.
We are neither to falter nor hesitate because the increasing
light, which is dissipating ignorance and extending the boundaries
of truth, is at the same time indirectly opening to error
a wider field for the distribution of her forces, revealing new
weapons for her armory, and enabling her to seize and for a
season to retain, positions hitherto unknown and unassailed.
In the history of the physical sciences, and of archæological
discovery, error has often rushed to the battlements of truth,
and, seizing some detached or imaginary facts, has wielded
them against the Bible, until the sciences have themselves expelled
her, and repudiated her reasoning. Such agitation is
not to be deplored; it conducts to stability, it evokes more good
than evil, and not unfrequently has it happened that the superstition
which long benumbed the Church, and the infidelity
which aroused her, have yielded to the unexpected sway of
some Bible truth, when a more definite meaning has been
given to some natural law or Providential dispensation.</p>

<p>Those misunderstand the character of the Bible who suppose
its safety lies in keeping it as far as possible from the rigorous
investigations and the exact conclusions of science or philosophy.
Such a method is indispensable. To pursue truth in
one department, implies, or should imply, not only a love of
truth in every department, but also a resolute purpose to discover
and dislodge every error. Which of the sciences, as
preserved from controversy, is entitled to cast the first stone at
the others, or their students? “Philosophy and literature,”
says Lord Kinloch, in an admirable work, “while professing to
pursue truth in the composure of unruffled seclusion, and to
be desirous of having it elicited by the healthy excitement of
friendly debate, will protest against the dishonor of soiling their
hands, or disarranging their robes in the turmoil of heated controversy;
and least of all will they consent to be defiled with
the mire or exposed to the perils of religious strife. This plea
is false in fact, as it is futile in philosophy. It is in fact false;
for literary and philosophical controversies have neither been
few in number nor wanting in a keen and rancorous spirit.
And, admitting that religious contentions have been still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
rancorous and embittered, it is only what might be reasonably
expected, on account of the higher interests at stake. The
plea is, moreover, worthless on philosophical principles; for it
eviscerates the distinction between truth and error of all meaning
and value. Better not to admit the distinction at all, than,
having admitted it in one instance, deny it in another; or, what
is worse, depreciate its significance even to thought, and that
too in the most important of its applications. All argument
and all effort are forever at an end, unless truth,—yea, all truth,—be
precious; so precious, that in the legitimate pursuit of it
we may and ought to put forth our utmost strength; and in defense
of it, when found, incur the utmost hazard.”</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged by apparently insurmountable obstacles.
The boldest assertions and the most plausible reasonings
need not disturb you. Difficulties seemingly insuperable have,
in the past, suddenly evanished in the light of unexpected discoveries;
and every science, you may rest assured, will hereafter
show strength enough and light enough to purify its own
temple and be its own interpreter. The past may be held to be
prophetic of future solutions; and the sciences will be found
not only correcting the mistakes and the arrogance of many of
their students, but rebuking the too hasty concessions of Christian
apologists, and either directly or indirectly revealing, at
the same time, the impressiveness and the majesty of scripture
truth.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>I.</h3>

<h4>I. DEFINITIONS—UTILITY OF THE SUBJECT.</h4>

<p>1. Social science comprises the statement and explanation of
the natural laws which govern men in their mutual relations.
Political economy is the application of that portion of those
laws which pertain to the production and distribution of wealth.
Now we are not to be discouraged by this term <i>wealth</i>, as though
the subject were one which concerns only rich men, and in
which a poor man could have no interest. The man who has
a little property, worth only one or two hundred dollars, is just
as really a possessor of wealth as one who has one or two millions;
and to be able to acquire and rightly use these small
fortunes is, in the aggregate, of more importance than the acquisition
and management of the greater riches of the few.</p>

<p>2. But what is meant by <i>wealth?</i> For the present it is enough
to say that <i>it comprises all things which have value</i>. A more
complete definition will follow by and by. What, then, do we
mean by <i>value?</i> This, too, has many forms of definition, but
they for the most part have one element in common. The general
notion concerning it is that it has reference to the amount of
one commodity that may be equitably given in exchange for a
designated amount of another; this is a correct notion. Thus
a bushel of wheat may be exchanged for two bushels of oats,
or a cord of wood for twenty yards of cloth. That is, the value
of a bushel of wheat is that of two bushels of oats, and the
value of twenty yards of cloth is the same as that of a cord of
wood. It is thus seen to be a <i>relative</i> term, and not indicative
of any quality of any one thing considered by itself. But in
all instances of relationship there must be some ground of the
relation. Let us try to determine what it is in this case. A
superficial thinker might decide that it is <i>money</i>, from the fact
that value is generally estimated in money. But money is itself
in the same relation to all other commodities in this respect as
they are to one another, and its value rests upon the same
basis.</p>

<p>3. The chief element in value, and that constitutes its original
standard, is the <i>cost of production;</i> and by <i>cost</i> is meant the
amount of labor involved. <i>Labor is the voluntary effort put
forth by man to secure some desired object.</i> But when we say
this, a little caution is needed. We are not to infer that the
present value of an article is estimated by the amount of labor
required at the time of its production, especially if that was a
long time ago. A hundred years since, it required the labor of
a man for days to produce a yard of cotton cloth. A dozen
yards of better cloth can now be produced by the same amount
of labor; of course the present value of the latter is superior to
the present value of the former, even if this were as good as
new. It is the labor that would be required to <i>reproduce</i> or replace
an article which determines its value.</p>

<p>4. But there is another element which is essential to value;
this is <i>utility</i>. It comprises all those qualities in an object which
make it available to gratify any desire. It will readily be seen
that there are objects which have utility and at the same time
are without value. They are such objects as cost nothing; that
is, such as involve no labor in their acquisition. Thus air, and
sunshine, and rain, have no value; but they are of immeasurable
utility. Value is often in the inverse ratio of utility. Iron
is a far more useful metal than gold, but gold is vastly more
valuable than iron. Still, though utility may exist where there
is no value, there can be no value where there is no utility;
because no one would put forth effort for that which could not
gratify any desire, and it is the ability to gratify desire that constitutes
utility. Sometimes utility becomes the paramount element
in determining value; but ordinarily it is subordinate to
the cost of production. When the article is one for which
there is a very great demand, and of which there is a great
scarcity, the value may increase many times beyond the cost.
In such case the utility rather than cost rules. But where the
demand is readily and fully met by the supply, the cost
controls.</p>

<p>5. But valuable things can not be produced very largely without
tools, implements, and various contrivances. These constitute
<i>capital</i>. <i>Capital is the result of previous labor reserved
and employed in further production.</i> This implies self-denial.
A man can not consume what he has secured by labor and at
the same time preserve it to aid in additional production. Hence
he must restrain his desires if he would save something for this
purpose. This capital is sometimes called pre-existent labor.
The point to be observed is that its existence is due, not to labor
alone, but to <i>abstinence</i> as well. The two elements in the cost
of production are labor and abstinence, and we may combine
these in the one term, <i>sacrifice</i>. Sacrifice and utility, then, are
the two essential conditions of value; and we may complete
our definition of value by saying that <i>value is man’s estimate
of the amount of sacrifice requisite to the attainment of a desired
object</i>.</p>

<p>6. Hence, if wealth comprises all valuable objects, and if
every desirable object which involves sacrifice has value, it
would be a proper definition to say that <i>wealth consists of all
those objects and qualities useful to man, the attainment of which
involves sacrifice</i>. This includes not only material objects and
qualities, but also all those human powers acquired by sacrifice,
which enable man to master nature. This is not admitted by
many writers. But Mr. Carey states, in a broad way, that
“Wealth is the power to command the always gratuitous services
of nature.” When man is at his weakest nature does
nothing for him. Every infant, if dependent on nature alone,
would inevitably perish. So in the infancy of society, it is only
by the most strenuous exertion that a precarious existence is
secured. But with every increment of power in man, nature
multiplies her services. They are not bought but freely given,
and given as soon as man is able to command them. In the
most advanced civilization the forces of nature have become so
subservient to man that in thousands of cases one can accomplish
what a score, or sometimes even a hundred, could not
formerly have done. It is this increase of power more than
that of material commodities which constitutes the real wealth
of the world.</p>

<p>7. From this it follows that the proper subject of political
economy is <small>MAN</small>. The laws pertaining to the underlying science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
are found in the nature and character of man—in his tastes,
his desires, in the motives influencing him and in the limitations
to which he is subject. The results to be achieved are his prosperity
and freedom, his mastery over nature, and his happiness.
Here, then, is the prime reason why every person who aspires
to any intelligence at all should have some acquaintance with
this subject. It has to do more than any other study with his
temporal welfare, and with the welfare of society, without the
prosperity of which his individual prosperity will suffer.</p>

<p>8. A second reason is implied in the meaning of the terms
used. Economy is from a Greek compound signifying <i>husbandry</i>.
It has reference to the prudent management by a
householder of his means so as to secure the largest measure
of prosperity for his family. It does not mean parsimony, nor
even mere frugality; that is, it does not consist in mere abstinence
for the sake of saving. It is rather a wise use of means
and forces, so as to make them as effective as possible. There
is an old proverb which says, “There is more in calculation
than in hard work,” and though sometimes perverted in the interest
of human laziness, it is nevertheless full of philosophy.
It is this “calculation” which such a study greatly aids.</p>

<p>9. <i>Political</i> economy, as the term implies, has reference to
man in society,—to “the body politic.” The social element in
man is as imperative as any part of his constitution. Man’s
greatest need is <i>association</i>. The solitary individual is only a
minute constituent of man in man’s relation to the main purposes
of life. No man is complete in himself. He must be
supplemented by others, generally by many others, and he
must find a large part of his own completeness in this association.
Each has something that others lack, and we are designed
to be sources of mutual supply to our several wants.</p>

<p>Here emerges another vital fact. <i>Individuality</i> is as indispensable
as association. A superficial thinker might regard
these characteristics as antagonistic. The fact is so far otherwise
that each is really dependent on the other. Men must
<i>differ</i> in order to be of any use to one another. It is the difference
that makes the individuality. Mutual aid is the object of
association. Hence the greater the difference, the greater the
individuality; and the greater the individuality, the greater the
association. No man would associate with another unless the
one had something which the other lacked. But for this there
would be no commerce. Two farmers producing nothing but
wheat would have nothing to exchange with each other. Two
men of precisely the same mental possessions, habits and aptitudes,
would never be companions for each other.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is only by association that individuality
becomes the most highly developed. Only by such development
do the differences among men become great and numerous.
In the lower grades of humanity there is comparatively
little difference between individuals, and there is little association.
It is only in advanced civilization that a strongly marked
individuality exists, and that we find those numerous differences
which make the mutual dependence the greatest. Here
is a potent reason for the study of this subject. It is impossible
to estimate the power of association in production alone. It is
known in a general way that the combination of men gives
greatly increased results as compared with those of men working
separately. Yet it is not nearly realized that a hundred men
properly associated in an industrial enterprise will often effect
two or three hundred times as much as all the very same men
working separately.</p>

<p>10. Again, this subject intimately concerns man in his governmental
relations. For governments must furnish many of
the conditions for the best economical results. Then, too, the
great moral enterprises of the age, and of all ages, have to do
with the principles here involved; education, pauperism, vicious
social usages, the dangerous classes, have to be considered,
and can only rightly be considered in the light of these
truths. It is wonderful how closely this study is connected
with all the great interests of humanity. Whole communities
which have been impoverished and demoralized by neglecting
some of the obvious principles of political economy, have revived
and prospered under their application. Portions of our
own country are examples of both these kinds of effects, and
that, too, within the memory of men now living.</p>

<p>We shall follow the usual plan of the division of the subject
under the heads of <i>production, consumption, exchange and distribution</i>.</p>


<h4>II. PRODUCTION—LABOR.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Production is the creation of value by rendering the utilities
of nature available to man.</i> The creation, it will be noticed,
is not of matter but of value. There are two great
agencies which must co-operate in production—<i>nature</i> and
<i>man</i>. Man furnishes labor; nature furnishes materials and
forces. The former would be useless without the latter. There
must be soils, and mines, and trees, and animals, or no matter
how much labor there may be, there can be no grain, nor fruit,
nor metals, nor lumber; no houses and no meat, nor hides nor
leather. So also there may be all kinds of material, but without
labor they are of no available service to man.</p>

<p>2. But nature furnishes not only materials but also forces to
aid man in his productive efforts. The more obvious and palpable
of these are gravitation, especially in falling water, wind,
the explosive property of gunpowder and dynamite, the expansive
power of steam, magnetism, electricity, and the forces of
vegetation. There are also numerous passive powers, or properties
of matter which, when adapted by man, give him much
advantage; such are the mechanical powers of the lever, inclined
plane, wheel and axle, pulley and wedge, and those
qualities of the metals which render them capable of taking an
edge for cutting purposes, as also malleability, ductility, elasticity,
etc. It is a beneficent fact of nature that she furnishes
these materials and forces gratuitously. She is not churlish nor
parsimonious in this respect. The more we avail ourselves of
her help, the more ready she is to help us; and the greater the
advantage we obtain, the more lavishly she bestows her gifts
upon us.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that labor consists not in creating things but in
<i>moving</i> them; that is, in effecting changes. It directs the natural
forces to the service of man, and it is in this that production
consists. It can move materials into position where these forces
can act upon them with the desired effect. Thus an agricultural
laborer can effect such changes in the soil as are requisite
to the growth of corn; he can place the seed in the ground, but
he can not make the crop. It is as impossible for him to create
a kernel of grain as to create a planet. Labor may move the
fuel to the fire-place and properly dispose it for kindling. It
may move a match, which by a previous movement has taken
fire, to the prepared fuel; but all this would be useless but for
the conditions and forces which nature furnishes.</p>

<p>3. The application of labor to production is of two kinds,
<i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i>. The direct changes effected by labor may
be embraced under the three heads of <i>transmutation</i>, <i>transformation</i>,
and <i>transportation</i>. The first comprises elementary
changes, as when under required conditions ingredients of the
soil and of the atmosphere are changed into grain and vegetables,
and fruit. The second is where there is simply a change
in the form of the material, as when boards are made into a
table, or leather into shoes. The third implies merely a change
of place, as when coal in a mine, where it has no value, becomes
valuable by being brought within reach of those who
desire it for fuel.</p>

<p>4. The greater part of labor is indirect; in some cases so
much so that its relation to the product is unseen. For instance,
the man who makes your shoes is not the only laborer concerned
in that product. Some previous labor produced the leather,
and before that some labor produced the hide from which the
leather was made; some persons made the tools, some the
house or shop, and some provided sustenance for the shoemaker.
All these are conditions, without which no shoes can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
be made, and all who provide them furnish a part of the labor
on which the product of the shoes depends.</p>

<p>Of this indirect labor there are several kinds. (1) Those who
provide the materials, and there may be many grades of these;
(2) those who furnish the implements and the machinery;
(3) those who supply the sustenance and shelter, and raiment
for the laborers; (4) the government agencies for protecting the
workman; (5) organizers and managers of business enterprises,
without whom production would often fall far short of what it
now accomplishes; (6) the labor of raising children who are
subsequently to become laborers; (7) all those engaged in the
work of education, by which men are prepared for the most
efficient work—this includes not only teachers, but writers,
clergymen, etc.; (8) professional men, who devote themselves
to matters essential to the interests of the community and thus
not only save the time of the laborers, but often their property
and their health, and their lives; (9) inventors and discoverers,
who ascertain new conditions of more efficient production.
These are the principal, though there are also others.</p>

<h2><a name="READINGS_IN_ART" id="READINGS_IN_ART">READINGS IN ART.</a></h2>


<h3>I.—SCULPTURE: ITS VARIETIES AND MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>All work cut out in a solid material, in imitation of natural
objects, is called sculpture. Thus carvings in wood, ivory-stone,
marble, metal, and works moulded from wax and clay,
come under the head of sculpture.</p>

<p>But sculpture, as we are about to consider it, is to be distinguished
by the term <i>statuary</i> from all carved work belonging
to ornamental art and glyptics. It must be borne in mind,
however, that the sculptor does not ordinarily carve his work
directly out of the marble; he first makes his statue, or bas
relief, in clay or wax. This method enables him to “sketch in
clay” and perfect his work in this obedient material. Michael
Angelo, and many great masters could dispense with this and
carve at once the statue from the block. The modeling in clay
is, however, generally the primary work. The “model,” as it
is called, is afterward moulded, and by means of this mould a
cast of the original clay statue, or bas-relief, is taken by the
use of liquid plaster. The clay model is, therefore, like the
original drawing of a painter—a master work.</p>

<p>The model completed, most of the carving is done by a
skilled laborer, the sculptor taking it up to give the finish,
which a master-hand alone can bestow. The copying of the
model into marble is accomplished by means of a method of
mechanical measurement, or “pointing.” The model and the
block of marble are both fastened to a base called a “scale-stone,”
to which a standard vertical rod can be attached at
corresponding centers, having at its upper end a sliding needle,
so adapted by a movable joint as to be set at any angle and
fastened by a screw when so set. The master sculptor having
marked the governing points with a pencil on the model the
instrument is applied to these and the measure taken. The
standard being then transferred to the block-base, the pointer,
guided by his measure, cuts away the marble, taking care to
leave it rather larger than the model, so that the general proportions
are kept, and the more important work is then left for
the master hand.</p>

<p>The character of work is influenced by the nature of the
material in which the sculptor carves; the harder the stone the
more difficult to give it the pliant forms of life. It is remarkable
that the most ancient and perfect Egyptian statues should have
been formed of very hard stones; and, as the ancient Egyptians
were not acquainted with steel, they must have been dependent
upon bronze, of various degrees of hardness, for their cutting
tools. These works are remarkable for their excellence, both
of form and proportion, and in the finish given to the details
of feature, the dress, and the ornaments.</p>

<p>Assyrian sculpture was in softer stones, limestones and alabaster;
only small objects, such as seals, being worked in hard
stones.</p>

<p>Greek and Roman sculptors made many statues and bas-reliefs
in hard stones, such as basalt, granite, and porphyry.
The extreme difficulty of such work may be understood when
it is seen that the ordinary method of the chisel and mallet, in
the most skillful hands, would be quite unavailing in this hard
material. The treadle-wheel, the drill, and the file, are brought
to aid the chisel, and even these require the use of emery upon
the wheel of the lapidary, in the manner in which the hardest
stones are cut.</p>

<p>Clay modeled and dried in the sun, or hardened by the fire,
was naturally one of the early forms in which sculpture was
developed. At once ready to hand, and easily modeled, it was
adopted for the same reasons that made clay convenient for
the ordinary vessels of every-day use. We find countless
numbers of these baked, or sun-dried clay figures. They have
escaped destruction because of the little value of the material
and because they resist decay. The Egyptians and Assyrians
applied a vitreous glaze to terra-cotta objects, which made them
more decorative and more durable.</p>

<p>Terra-cotta was chosen by many sculptors to preserve the
spirit and freedom of the original. Although some shrinking
under the action of the fire must be allowed for, yet what is
well baked is certain to possess the excellence of the fresh clay.
It escapes the chances of over-finish, which too often befalls
marble and bronze.</p>

<p>Another form of sculpture to be noticed is called <i>chryselephantine</i>,
on account of the combined use of gold and ivory;
the nude parts of the figure being of ivory, probably with color
applied to the features and the drapery of gold. The statue
was substantially but roughly made in marble, with wood, perhaps,
upon it; the ivory being laid on in thick pieces.</p>

<p>Statues of wood, of various kinds, were made by the most
ancient sculptors. Many small figures in wood, the work of
the Egyptian carvers, are to be seen in the museums, and the
mummy cases show the practice of carving the head, while the
trunk is left only partly shaped out of the block.</p>

<p>Bronze was one of the most important forms of ancient statuary.
It must be remembered that bronze is an entirely different
alloy from brass, the former being an alloy of copper and tin,
while brass is of copper and zinc. Small proportions of gold,
silver, lead, and iron, were mixed with the bronze by ancient
metal-workers to give various colors to their work; thus a blush
of shame was produced by allowing the iron in the bronze to
rust. Plutarch mentions a face which was pale, the sculptor
having mixed silver with the bronze.</p>

<p>The primitive bronze-workers, before they arrived at the
knowledge of casting, began by hammering solid metals into
shapes. The <i>toreutic</i> art, although not definitely known at
present, was probably that of hammering, punching, and chiseling
plates of metal, either separately or with a view of fixing
them upon stone or wood. Both the solid hammered work and
the hollow-plate work is mentioned by the authorities. The
hollow statues were built up in pieces, fastened together with
nails, rivets, and dove-tails, and it is not improbable that some
system of welding was practiced.</p>

<p>The casting of metals in moulds must have followed the discovery
that they could be melted. As the sculptor improved in
his art of modeling he would be able to make better moulds.
He would soon observe that the solid statue was not only very
costly, but so very heavy that the whole figure would collapse from
sheer weight.</p>

<p>This trouble was corrected by the discovery of a contrivance
for casting metals in a hollow mould. It was done
pretty much as it is at the present day, by fixing within the
mould a <i>core</i>, which did not touch the sides, except at certain
small points necessary for support. The space between this
and the surface of the mould was to be filled by the molten
metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>There is still another method, less common in modern times,
but employed by the ancients, for some of their smaller works.
This is when a wax model is encased in clay or plaster of Paris
and the molten metal then poured into it to melt the wax, and
take the form of the work precisely as it left the hand of the
sculptor. The original model is thus destroyed and the bronze
takes its place. Some very large and important works have
recently been cast in this method, but with the core. In bronze
casting with a core, this contrivance must be made with great
care. The mould, which is obliged to be formed of pieces fitted
together, in order that the model may be taken out, is first well
soaked in oil, then melted wax is applied to the inner side of
the moulded parts in such thickness as may be required in the
metal of the completed statue. But as a hollow metal statue
would not be strong enough to support its own weight, a sort of
skeleton of iron bars is made to take the general form of the
figure, and this strong frame-work is firmly fixed within the
mould. We have then the mould, with its wax lining, enclosing
the iron skeleton, or <i>armature</i>, as it is called, with an opening
left in the proper place to allow of pouring in the liquid plaster
of Paris mixed with pounded brick, which fills the space about
the armature. Therefore, if at this stage, the mould were taken
to pieces again, the sculptor would behold his statue as one of
apparently solid wax. Practically this is done in order that he
may satisfy himself of the success of his work, and correct it
where necessary. The model is then again placed in the mould
preparatory to casting.</p>

<p><i>Galvano-plastique</i>, or the use of electricity, to deposit a thin
layer of metal in a pure state upon a model, is an important
invention or application of science to art.</p>

<p>Having described the various materials and methods employed
in sculptured art, we are ready to classify the
different forms adopted and arrange them under the proper
terms.</p>

<p>Sculpture in relief is the first division. There are four varieties.
<i>Bas-relief</i>, or <i>basso-relievo</i>, is the term used when the
work projects from the plain surface, the forms being rounded
as in nature. If the work is very little raised, the forms being
not so projecting as in nature, it is called <i>flat-relief</i>, or <i>stiacciato</i>.
If more raised, but not free from the ground in any place, it is
<i>half-relief</i> or <i>mezzo-relievo</i>. If the relief is still higher it becomes
<i>full-relief</i>, or <i>alto-relievo</i>, in which parts of the human
figure are entirely free from the ground of the slab. In
<i>sunk-relief</i>, or <i>cavo-relievo</i>, the work is recessed within
an outline, but still raised in flat relief, not projecting above
the surface of the slab. Much of the renaissance and
modern sculpture combines the first-named kinds of work on
different planes in degrees of distance, with some under-cutting.
The beauty and character of bas-relief depend much upon the
representation of outline.</p>

<p>Statuary proper is sculpture in the round. The statue is
therefore seen on every side.</p>

<p>Statues are, (1) standing; (2) seated; (3) recumbent; (4)
equestrian.</p>

<p>Statues are classed into five forms as to size: Colossal, above
the heroic standard; heroic, above six feet but under the colossal;
life-size; small life-size; statuettes, half the size of life and
smaller.</p>

<p>To know the proper proportions of the figures is a matter of
the utmost value in all sculpture, even more so than in painting,
as the statue is measurable on every side and in every
direction. It would have been impossible for the ancient Egyptians
to carve out of the living rock their tremendous figures
unless they had arrived at a rule of proportion for their figure.
Without this their colossi would have been only rude monsters.
Such a rule they had discovered and laid down in a canon, as
it is called, similar to that which was followed by the Greek
sculptors after them, and especially made known by Polycletus,
whose name it received. Though there is some doubt about
the precise terms of the canon, there can be no doubt that it
had for its unit of measurement some part of the human figure.
The version of Vitruvius Pollio is supposed to be the correct
one. He says: “Nature has so composed the human body
that the face, from the chin to the top of the forehead, and the
roots of the hair, should be a tenth part; also the palm of the
hand from the wrist-joint to the tip of the middle finger; the
head from the chin to the highest point, an eighth; from the
top of the chest to the roots of the hair, a sixth.”</p>

<p>The rule of ten faces, or eight heads, derived from this, has
remained to the present time. Several sculptors of a later period,
who have given much attention to the subject of proportion,
differ slightly from the canon of Polycletus, though it is
commonly accepted.</p>

<p>That strict rules of symmetrical proportion should be followed
is necessary in all statuary, but especially in that which serves
as a decoration for architecture. The knowledge of the figure
acquired by eminent sculptors inspired them with admiration
for the beautiful, and enabled them to express in the creation
of their art an ideal of grand beauty, which was guided by a
taste and feeling which rarely failed to direct them aright. It
was the greatest sculptor of modern times, Michael Angelo, who
said that the sculptor should carry “his compasses in his eye.”
Some one comments on this that, “Sculptors, and painters
especially, dread the rule of geometry. They regard rule as a
fetter upon their invention, not dreaming that this great man
(Michael Angelo), before he expressed himself thus, had for so
long a time had the compasses in his hand.” This points to a
profound truth in all practical art, that no man can be a great
artist unless he have the power of drawing in the true proportions
of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Having pointed out the leading points in the technic of sculpture,
we take up its history, beginning naturally with the earliest
forms as found in Egypt.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, inhabiting a flat, uniform country, of pure
and salubrious climate, working as sculptors before a written
language was invented, carved their colossal sphinx almost
entirely out of the living rock; an amazing example of symbolic
sculptural representation, combining the human with the
brute form of the lion. The date of this first great work is
probably earlier than that of the earliest pyramids—that built
by Chofo, King of Memphis, the Cheops of Herodotus, and the
larger one by Nef Chofo, his son. M. Renan, speaking for M.
Mariette, states that a tablet was found by him recording that
Nef Chofo did certain repairs to the sphinx; so that since it
required repairs, it must already have existed for a considerable
time. All small barbaric or archaic work of the ancient Egyptians
in sculpture has perished in the vast lapse of time. But
this one monument, raised at least 4,000 years before the
Christian era, stands to prove, with its companion pyramids,
the wonderful power of conception, the energy and practical
skill which characterized the early Egyptians. What they lacked
in ideas of beauty, they made up for by the simple grandeur in
the colossal size and perfection in execution.</p>

<p>The intention of producing a monument to last forever was
shown in an equally striking manner in the construction of the
pyramids, and with an exercise of science and skill even more
remarkable.</p>

<p>Egyptian art, in the form of architecture, was, after the
pyramids of Ghizeh, further developed about 1650 B. C., under
Osirtesen I., who built the oldest of the temples at Thebes.
Columns and obelisks were then invented, and the <i>cavi relievi</i>
were largely used. Statuary, however, did not advance until
after the Phœnician Shepherd Kings—a body of wandering
Arabs, so called, who conquered Upper Egypt for a time—were
driven out by Amosis, King of Thebes, about 1450 B. C.</p>

<p>Passing over Amunothph I. and his successor Thothmosis I.,
of whom there is a fine statue in the Turin Museum, we come
to Thothmosis II., whose reign marks a period of vast development,
as he married Nitocris, the last Queen of Memphis,
capital of Lower Egypt, and thus united the two kingdoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about 1340 B. C. The great avenue of sphinxes, leading to the
temple of Karnak, was made in her reign, and there is a statue
of Thothmosis II., a seated figure seven feet nine inches high,
in good proportions, of about seven heads high, the fingers and
toes straight, not showing the knuckles, and the legs sharply
chiseled at the shins, not showing the small bone on the outside
of the leg, as in the statues of the later time of Amunothph III.
(about 1260 B. C.).</p>

<p>The famous colossus, called the musical Memnon, one of the
two still standing in the desert near Thebes, more than fifty
feet high, is of this period. These statues are not in good
proportion, being too short in the waist. The two fine lions,
carved in red granite, belonging to this time, which Lord
Prudhoe brought over and presented to the British Museum,
are remarkable as examples of fine typical treatment of the
lion. They show much grandeur of feeling, and, compared
with the modern naturalistic sculpture of lions, they are superior
as examples of monumental art.</p>

<p>In 1170 B. C. reigned Ramses II., the greatest of the Egyptian
kings, under whom was invented all the wonderful adaptation
of the lotus and papyrus plant to the design of columns, as seen
in the famous colonnade of the hall of Karnak. His statue,
in the Turin Museum, is in the finest style of ancient Theban
art; it is a seated figure carved out of a block of black granite,
and is not colossal, being only five feet seven inches high. The
point to be noticed in this statue is the effort at action, which is
not seen in earlier works. The right hand is raised to the breast
holding the short sort of crosier of the god Osiris; the left hand
resting on the knee, strongly clenched. The colossal statue of
Ramses, as Osiris, may be taken as examples, with that of the
Memnon, in the British Museum, of the sculpture of this time.
The large sphinx in the Louvre bears the name of Ramses II.
The four-seated colossi, carved out of the living rock at the
entrance of the great temple of Abou Simbel in Ethiopia, represent
the same king. They are between sixty and seventy feet
high, and wonderfully well sculptured, but the proportions are
not so good as in some smaller statues, as they are six heads
only in height, and short in the waist and thick in the limbs,
showing no attempt at any close or correct imitation of nature.
They look straight before them with a calm smile of confident
power and contentment. These statues, and others which are
to be seen in the museums, are not equal to those of the time
of Amunothph III., previously referred to; they are not so well
carved, and the features are heavy, with thick noses and lips,
while the limbs are clumsy, and without any attempt at accurate
modeling.</p>

<p>It will be observed, therefore, that Egyptian sculpture may be
classed broadly into three styles. (1) the Egyptian proper,
reaching its finest period in the reign of Amunothph III.; (2)
the Ethiopic Egyptian; (3) the later Egyptian, leading to the
decline of that style of sculpture. Of the first it should be
noticed that the general proportions of the figure were more
accurately considered than the relative proportions of hands
and feet to the limbs, which are generally incorrect. There are,
however, some examples of excellent proportion, as in a colossal
arm and fist in the British Museum. This arm belonged to
a statue of Thothmes III., and came from Memphis. It is
about ten feet long. The fist also came from Memphis, and
measures four feet across. The heads of statues of this period
are of the pure Coptic type, with a nose somewhat aquiline, and
the lips comparatively thin. The eyes, however, were always
carved in full in profile representations; the feet, one in advance
of the other on the same plane. The details of form at the
knuckles and legs are well indicated.</p>

<p>In the Ethiopic-Egyptian statues, general proportion is lost
sight of; the figures become dumpy, being only six heads high;
the limbs are clumsy and wanting in modeling; the hands and
feet stiff and not marked by details at the joints; nor do they
show the small bone of the leg. The heads are more of the
Negro type, with turned-up noses and thick lips.</p>

<p>In the later Egyptian it is remarkable that with more attempt
to imitate nature in the modeling of the muscles, the forms of
the trunk and limbs become unnaturally puffed. More is
added in symbolic attributes; heads of the cat, the hawk,
and the ape, are placed on the human body; the dress is more
elaborate, that of the head especially, on which a disc for the
sun was often placed, as on the god Osiris. From the fall of
Thebes, about 1000 B. C., to the conquest of Egypt by the
Persians, 523 B. C., sculpture became more and more degraded,
and soon lost its original style of simplicity and grandeur of
form.</p>

<p>After some two centuries of rule, the Persians were conquered
by Alexander the Great, 332 B. C., but there are no
statues of Greek style of this date found in Egypt; under the
Ptolemies, his successors for 300 years, new temples of inferior
but still Egyptian style were built, such as those at Phile, Edfou,
and Denderah, and many statues were made, but nearly all
have been destroyed, and there is not one of any king or queen
of the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>After Egypt became a Roman province, in 38 B. C., Egyptian
sculpture, in a debased form, was still continued upon the decoration
of the temples, but the statues were then in the hands of
Greek artists. Still later, there is the well-known statue of
Antinous as an Egyptian, the work of a Greek sculptor of the
time of the Emperor Hadrian (A. D. 117-138).</p>

<p>Assyrian sculpture is a discovery of recent times, first made
in 1842-3 by Botta, the French consul at Mosul on the banks of
the Tigris, and almost simultaneously by Mr. Layard, who
though he had seen the ruins of Nineveh in 1840 did not get
permission to examine and excavate till 1845. The sculptures
differ widely from any in Egypt in being nearly all in bas-relief
and high relief. There are very few statues, carved in the
round, that stand either with a support practically or on the legs.
There are no colossi nearly approaching in size the Egyptian
and Greek colossal statues, none being higher than eighteen
feet, while as we have seen sixty feet was a moderate height for
an Egyptian or Greek colossal figure, and some were higher.
The colossal human-headed bulls and lions with wings, at the
portals of the king’s palace, are in high relief on huge slabs, one
on each side, facing outwards, and one on each side on the
wall, with the head turned to look to the front. It does not appear
that any principal figure was set up in an interior, either
of these compound animals, or of any deity or king. No
colossal seated figures like the Egyptian statues have been
found. The standing figures carved in relief differ entirely in
the expression of the countenance and motive of the figure from
the Egyptian. They have all some action; the king grasps a
captured lion, or as chief priest he walks with his staff which he
holds firmly, while the left hand rests on the hilt of his sword.
It is true that the legs are on one plane, and the feet in a position
that could not support the body; still the intention to show
action and life is there. There is none of the desire to express
majestic, calm, eternal repose and content which is so characteristic
of Egyptian sculptured statues. Throughout the great
number of slabs in the British Museum and in the Louvre there is
a very vigorous descriptive power displayed in carving figures of
men, horses, chariots, battles, sieges of cities, hunting scenes,
processions, rivers with men swimming on inflated skins, with
fish and boats; implements, weapons, chairs, baskets, trees,
birds, buildings, with a close resemblance to the real objects
that is very distinctive of the Assyrian style. The quadrupeds
and birds are much better done than the human figures; the
character of some of the mules is faithfully given, and there is
much feeling for nature in some of the lions in the hunting-scenes.
There is no doubt, also, that this naturalistic realism
was carried further by painting the sculptures. In none of
these painted reliefs, however, is there anything of the careful
carving and delicate delineation of the Egyptian <i>cavi relievi;</i>
they are all boldly done, and with a good deal of skill, but by
hands that would seem to have been self-taught, and at liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to represent as they pleased so that the conventional attributes
and symbolic objects were duly made clear. There is scarcely
any regulated use of typical forms; and in the proportions of
the figures especially there is no rule. The principal figures
are about 6½ heads high, and in others the heads are often
larger, while the arms and legs are out of all proportion gigantic,
the muscles being exaggerated into masses at the calf and
knee, and the shin-bone absurdly prominent. All truth seems
to have been sacrificed for the sake of conveying a violent look
of immense strength. The battle scenes remind us of some of
the puerile representations by mediæval workmen of a poor
style, or the debased Roman work seen on sarcophaguses.
The Assyrians, unlike the Egyptians, were “mighty hunters,”
consequently horses were favorites with the Assyrian carvers,
as they were with the Greek sculptors afterwards; they seldom
have more than one fore-leg and one hind one, but their heads
are carefully carved, and all the trappings show the same intention
to obtain exact resemblance as is displayed in the dress
and ornaments of the kings and other figures. It is
important to observe that these sculptures are very equal in
merit; there is no sign of improvement and little of falling off.
As to the date of these sculptures, they are much later than all
the Egyptian work of the finer style.</p>

<p>It may be concluded that the Assyrian palaces, with their
sculptured walls, took a much shorter time to build than the
Egyptian, as they were built of sun-baked bricks, with ornamental
slabs below, and wooden beams and columns above,
all which structures have perished leaving only the stone slabs.
The soft nature of the stone, which is a kind of grey alabaster,
extremely suited to carving in the manner employed, afforded
the facility that influenced the style and enabled the carvers to
indulge their inclination for realistic detail. They do not appear
to have sought for fine colored hard stones as the Egyptians
did, nor do they show the same desire to make their work
monumental and enduring.</p>

<p>Assyrian sculpture was always archaic, though at the same
time more vigorous in what might be called graphic sculpture,
and truer in imitation of nature than Egyptian, which rarely
attempted action in the figure or facial expression. There is,
however, no alliance between the two styles, and there was
never likely to be, as the Assyrians were not a people of poetic
and abstract ideas, but of facts, circumstances, and action.
They thought of the present glory, and did not trouble themselves
about the future. The same characteristics will partly
account for the absence of any kind of reference to a future
state. The tree of life with the priest ministering before it and
holding fruit is to be seen; but it is remarkable that no sepulchral
monuments have been found; no tomb or mark of regard
in any shape for the welfare of the dead hereafter has been
discovered.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the Assyrians were never a statue-making
people, and never attempted to follow the example of
the Egyptians—do we find them influencing the sculptural art
of any other people in work like that of the Assyrians? This
question is answered at once by the remains found at Persepolis,
where there are to be seen similar winged and human-headed
lions and bulls, and sculptured slabs, but no statues either in
the round or in alto-relievo.</p>

<p>The ruins of the palaces of Cambyses, Darius, and Xerxes,
the date of which is from 560 B. C. to the conquests of Alexander
the Great (331 B. C.), show only sculptural remains left, after
all the soft brick walls and the wooden beams and rafters have
long perished. Persian sculptural art since those days never
advanced to the dignity of statuary, but like its Assyrian predecessor
stopped short where Greek art began to develop. The
same is to be observed of that ramification of the Assyrian arts
which is to be traced in the building of the temple of Jerusalem
under Solomon, which, however, was some five centuries before
the time of Cambyses, and about the same length of time
after the settling of the Israelites in the Delta of the Nile
(1550 <small>B. C.</small>). The law of Moses was sufficient to prevent any
sculpture in the likeness of living things; but the cherubim,
with their wings, seem to have been borrowed from the Assyrians.
The temple was, no doubt, built of stone and cedar-wood
after the manner of the Assyrians, and with a profusion of ornament
in carving, of valuable marbles, wood, and embossed
work in precious metals.</p>

<p>The colossal sculptures in the rock-cut temples of India,
whether taken as derived from the Assyrian centre or not, may
be classed with that style as semi-barbaric and naturalistic,
with a superadded symbolism which only led to the most extravagant
deformities of the human figure to express the power
and attributes of a deity. Statuary proper never existed in any
shape of beauty like the human form, throughout Persia, India,
and China, and there is no sign of any disposition amongst the
Asiatics to learn the art from their European conquerors; it is
not in their nature.</p>

<p>The parts I speak of are the most renowned countries and
kingdoms; once the seats of most glorious and triumphant
empires; the theaters of valor and heroical actions; the soils
enriched with all earthly felicities; the places where Nature
hath produced her wonderful works; where arts and sciences
have been invented and perfected; where wisdom, virtue, policy,
and civility, have been planted, have flourished; and, lastly,
where God himself did place his own commonwealth, gave
laws and oracles, inspired his prophets, sent angels to converse
with men; above all, where the Son of God descended to become
man; where he honored the earth with his beautiful steps,
wrought the works of our redemption, triumphed over death,
and ascended into glory; which countries, once so glorious and
famous for their happy estate, are now, through vice and ingratitude,
become the most deplored spectacles of extreme
misery; the wild beasts of mankind having broken in upon
them, and rooted out all civility, and the pride of a stern and
barbarous tyrant possessing the thrones of ancient and just
dominion. Who, aiming only at the height of greatness and
sensuality, hath in tract of time reduced so great and goodly a
part of the world to that lamentable distress and servitude,
under which (to the astonishment of the understanding beholders)
it now faints and groaneth. Those rich lands at this present
remain waste and overgrown with bushes, receptacles of wild
beasts, of thieves, and murderers; large territories dispeopled
or thinly inhabited; goodly cities made desolate; sumptuous
buildings become ruins; glorious temples either subverted or
prostituted to impiety; true religion discountenanced and oppressed;
all nobility extinguished; no light of learning permitted,
nor virtue cherished; violence and rapine insulting over all, and
leaving no security except to an abject mind, and unlooked-on
poverty; which calamities of theirs, so great and deserved, are
to the rest of the world as threatening instructions. For assistance
wherein, I have not only related what I saw of their
present condition, but, so far as convenience might permit,
presented a brief view of the former estates and first antiquities
of those peoples and countries; thence to draw a right image
of the frailty of man, the mutability of whatever is worldly, and
assurance that, as there is nothing unchangeable saving God,
so nothing stable but by his grace and protection.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There were more than a few attempts of the English to people,
to settle and improve the parts of New England which were
to the northward of New Plymouth, but the designs of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
attempts being aimed no higher than the advancement of some
worldly interests, a constant series of disasters confounded
them, until there was a plantation erected on the nobler designs
of Christianity, and that plantation, though it has had more adversaries,
perhaps, than any one upon earth, yet, having obtained
help from God, it continues to this day. There have
been very fine settlements in the northeast regions, but what
is become of them? I have heard that one of our ministers,
once preaching to a congregation there, urged them to approve
themselves a religious people from this consideration: that
otherwise they would contradict the main object of planting
this wilderness, whereupon a well-known person, then in the
assembly, cried out: “Sir, you are mistaken, you think you are
preaching to the people at the Bay; our main end was to catch
fish.” Truly ’twere to have been wished that something more
excellent had been the main end of the settlements in that
brave country, which we have, even long since the arrival of
that more pious colony at the Bay, now seen dreadfully unsettled,
no less than twice, at least, by the sword of the heathen,
after they had been replenished by many hundreds of people
who had thriven to many thousands of pounds, and all the
force of the Bay, too, to assist them in maintaining their settlements.
But the same or like inauspicious things attended many
other endeavors to make plantations, on such a <i>main end</i>, in
several other parts of the country, before the arrival of the Massachusetts
colony, which was formed on more glorious aims.</p>


<h4>REMARKS ON THE CATALOGUE OF PLANTATIONS.</h4>

<p>(1) There are few towns to be now seen on our list but what
were existing in this land before the dreadful Indian war which
befell us twenty years ago; and there are few towns broken up
within the then Massachusetts line by that war but what have
revived out of their ashes. Nevertheless the many calamities
which have ever since been wasting the country have so nip
the growth of it, that its later progress hath held no proportion
with what was from the beginning; but yet with such variety,
that while the trained companies of some towns are no bigger
than they were thirty or forty years ago, others are as big
again.</p>

<p>(2) The calamities that have carried off the inhabitants of our
several towns have not been all of one sort. Pestilential sicknesses
have made fearful havoc in divers places, where the
sound have not perhaps been enough to tend the sick, while
others have not had one touch from the Angel of Death, and
the sword hath cut off scores in sundry places, when others,
it may be, have not lost a single man by that avenger.</p>

<p>(3) ’Tis no unusual, though no universal experiment, among
us, that while an excellent, laborious, illuminating ministry has
been continued in a town, the place has thriven to admiration;
but ever since that man’s time they have gone down the wind
in all their interests. The gospel has evidently been the
making of all our towns, and the blessings of the Upper have
been accompanied with the blessings of the Nether Springs.
Memorable also is the remark of Slingsby Beibel, Esq., in his
most judicious “Book of the Interests of Europe:” “Were not
the cold climate of New England supplied by good laws and
discipline, the barrenness of the country would never have
brought people to it, nor have advanced it in consideration and
formidableness above the other English plantations exceeding
it much in fertility and other inviting qualities.”</p>

<p>(4) Well may New England lay claim to the name it wears,
and to a room in the tenderest affections of its mother, the
happy island. For as there are few of our towns but what have
their namesakes in England, so the reason why most of our
towns are called what they are, is because the chief of the first
inhabitants would thus bear up the names of the particular
places there from whence they came.</p>

<p>(5) I have heard an aged saint, near his death, thus cheerfully
express himself: “Well, I am going to heaven, and I will
there tell the faithful who are gone long since from New England
thither, that though they who gathered in our churches are
all dead and gone, yet the churches are still alive, with as numerous
flocks of Christians as were ever among them.” Concerning
most of the churches in our catalogue, the report thus
carried unto heaven, I must now also send through the earth;
but if with “as numerous,” we could in every respect say as gracious,
what joy to all the saints, both in heaven and on earth,
might be from thence occasioned.—<i>Magnalia Christi Americana.</i></p>

<p>To take a poor child, especially an orphan left in poverty,
and bestow a liberal education on it, is an admirable charity,
yea, it may draw after it a long train of good, and may interest
you in all the good done by him whom you have educated.
Hence, also, what is done for schools, for colleges, and for hospitals
is done for the general good. The endowment and maintenance
of these is at once to do good to many.</p>

<p>But alas, how much of the silver and the gold is buried in
hands where it is little better than if conveyed back to the
mines whence it came. How much of it is employed to as little
purpose as what arrives at Hindoostan, where a great part of it,
after some circulation, is by the Moguls lodged in subterraneous
caves never to see the light again. The Christian whose faith
and hope are genuine, acts not thus.</p>

<p>Sometimes elaborate compositions may be prepared for the
press, works of great bulk, and of greater worth, by which the
best interests of knowledge and virtue might be considerably
promoted, but they lie, like the impotent man at the pool of
Bethesda, in silent neglect, and are likely to continue in that
state, till God inspires some wealthy persons nobly to subscribe
to their publication, and by this generous application of their
property to bring them abroad. The names of such noble
benefactors to mankind ought to live as long as the works
themselves live; and when the works do any good, what these
have done towards the publishing of them, ought to be “told
for a memorial of them.” He urges gentlemen of leisure to
seek “some honorable and agreeable employments,” and says,
“I will mention one: The Pythagoreans forbade men’s eating
their own brains, or keeping their good thoughts to themselves.”
The incomparable Boyle observes that as to religious books in
general, “those that have been written by laymen, and especially
by gentlemen, have (<i>cæteris paribus</i>) been better received
and more effectual than those published by clergymen.” Mr.
Boyle’s were certainly so. Men of quality have frequently attained
such accomplishments in languages and science that
they become prodigies of literature. Their libraries also have
stupendous collections approaching toward Vatican or Bodleian
dimensions. It were much to be wished that persons of wealth
and station would qualify themselves for the use of the pen, as
well as of the sword, and deserve this eulogium: “They have
written excellent things.” An English person of quality in his
treatise entitled “A view of the soul,” has the following passage:
“It is certainly the highest dignity, if not the greatest happiness
of which human nature is capable in the vale below, to have
the soul so far enlightened as to become a mirror, conduit or
conveyor of God’s truth to others.” It is a bad motto for a man
of capacity to say, “My understanding is unfruitful.” Gentlemen,
consider what subjects may most properly and usefully
fall under your cultivation. Your pens may stab atheism and
vice more effectually than other men’s can. If out of your
tribe there come those who handle the pen of the writer, they
will do uncommon execution. One of them has ingenuously
said, “Though I know of some <i>functions</i>, yet I know no <i>truths</i>
of religion that like the shew-bread belong to the priests
alone.” * * *</p>

<p>To do good is a sure and pleasant way effectually to bespeak
God’s blessings on ourselves. Who so likely to find blessings
as the men who are blessings? While we work for God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he certainly will work for us, and ours—will do for us more than
we have done for him; “more than we can ask or think.” A
good action is its own reward.</p>

<p>But what shall be done for the good man in the heavenly
world? His part and work in the city of God are at present
incomprehensible to us, but the kindness which his God will
show him in the strong city will be truly marvelous. The
attempts which the Christian has made to fill this world with
righteous things, are so many tokens for good to him, that he
shall have a portion in that world wherein shall dwell nothing
but righteousness. He will be welcomed with “Well done, good
and faithful servant.”</p>

<p>I will conclude with a declaration which I will boldly maintain.
It is this: Were a man able to write in seven languages,
could he daily converse with all the sweets of the liberal
sciences to which the most accomplished make pretensions;
were he to entertain himself with all ancient and modern history;
and could he feast continually on the curiosities which
the different branches of learning may discover to him, all this
would not afford the ravishing satisfaction which he might find
in relieving the distresses of a poor, miserable neighbor, nor
would it bear any comparison with the heartfelt delight which
he might have by doing service to the kingdom of our great
Savior in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="SPIRITUAL_KNOWLEDGE" id="SPIRITUAL_KNOWLEDGE">SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE.</a></h2>

<p class="center">By JONATHAN EDWARDS.</p>


<p>There is a kind of taste of the mind, whereby persons are
guided in their judgment of the natural beauty, gracefulness,
propriety, nobleness, and sublimity of speeches and action,
whereby they judge, as it were, by the glance of the eye, or by
inward sensation, and the first impression of the object; so
there is likewise such a thing as a divine taste, given and maintained
by the Spirit of God, in the hearts of the saints, whereby
they are in like manner led and guided in discerning and distinguishing
the true spiritual and holy beauty of actions; and
that more easily, readily, and accurately, as they have more or
less of the Spirit of God dwelling in them. And thus “the sons
of God are led by the Spirit of God, in their behavior in the
world.”</p>

<p>A holy disposition and spiritual taste, where grace is strong
and lively, will enable a soul to determine what actions are
right and becoming Christians, not only more speedily, but far
more exactly, than the greatest abilities without it. This may
be illustrated by the manner in which some habits of mind, and
dispositions of heart, of a nature inferior to true grace, will teach
and guide a man in his actions. As for instance, if a man be
a very good natured man, his good nature will teach him how
to act benevolently amongst mankind, and will direct him, on
every occasion, to those speeches and actions which are agreeable
to rules of goodness, than the strongest reason will a man
of a morose temper. So if a man’s heart be under the influence
of an entire friendship, and most endeared affection to another,
though he be a man of an indifferent capacity, yet this habit of
his mind will direct him, far more readily and exactly, to a
speech and deportment, or manner of behavior, which shall in
all respects be sweet and kind, and agreeable to a benevolent
disposition of heart, than the greatest capacity without it. He
has, as it were, a spirit within him, that guides him; the habit
of his mind is attended with a taste by which he immediately
relishes that air and mien which is benevolent, and disrelishes
the contrary, and causes him to distinguish between one and
the other in a moment, more precisely, than the most accurate
reasonings can find out in many hours. As the nature and inward
tendency of a stone, or other heavy body, that is let fall
from aloft, shows the way to the center of the earth more
exactly in an instant than the ablest mathematician, without it,
could determine, by his most accurate observations, in a whole
day. Thus it is that a spiritual disposition and taste teaches
and guides a man in his behavior in the world. So an eminently
humble, or meek, or charitable disposition, will direct a
person of mean capacity to such a behavior, as is agreeable to
Christian rules of humility, meekness and charity, far more
readily and precisely than the most diligent study and elaborate
reasonings of a man of the strongest faculties, who has not a
Christian spirit within him. So also will a spirit of love to God,
and holy fear and reverence toward God, and filial confidence
in God, and an heavenly disposition, teach and guide a man in
his behavior.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly difficult thing for a wicked man, destitute
of Christian principles in his heart to guide him, to know how
to demean himself like a Christian, with the life and beauty,
and heavenly sweetness of a truly holy, humble, Christ-like
behavior. He knows not how to put on these garments;
neither do they fit him.</p>

<p>The saints in thus judging of actions by a spiritual taste, have
not a particular recourse to express rules of God’s word, with
respect to every word and action that is before them, the good
or evil of which they thus judge: But yet their taste itself, in
general, is subject to the rule of God’s word, and must be tried
by that, and a right reasoning upon it. As a man of a rectified
palate judges of particular morsels by his taste; but yet his
palate itself must be judged of, whether it be right or no, by
certain rules and reasons. But a spiritual taste of soul mightily
helps the soul in its reasonings on the word of God, and in
judging the true meaning of its rules: As it removes the prejudices
of a depraved appetite, and naturally leads the thoughts
in the right channel, casts a light on the word of God, and
causes the true meaning, most naturally, to come to mind,
through the harmony there is between the disposition and relish
of a sanctified soul, and the true meaning of the rules of God’s
word. Yea, this harmony tends to bring the texts themselves
to mind, on proper occasions; as the particular state of the
stomach and palate tends to bring particular meats and drinks
to mind, as are agreeable to that state. “Thus the children of
God are led by the Spirit of God” in judging of actions themselves,
and in their meditations upon, and judging of, and applying
the rules of God’s holy word: And so God “teaches
them his statutes and causes them to understand the way of his
precepts;” which the Psalmist so often prays for.</p>

<p>But this leading of the spirit is a thing exceedingly diverse
from that which some call so; which consists not in teaching
them God’s statutes and precepts, that he has already given;
but in giving them new precepts by immediate inward speech
or suggestion, and has in it no tasting the true excellency of
things, or judging or discerning the nature of things at all.
They do not determine what is the will of God by any taste or
relish, or any manner of judging of the nature of things, but by
an immediate dictate concerning the thing to be done; there is
no such thing as judgment or wisdom in the case. Whereas,
in that leading of the spirit which is peculiar to God’s children,
is imparted that true wisdom and holy discretion, so often
spoken of in the word of God; which is high above the other
way, as the stars are higher than a glow worm; and that which
Balaam and Saul (who sometimes were led by the spirit in that
other way) never had, and no natural man can have without a
change of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="WAVERLEY_NOVELS" id="WAVERLEY_NOVELS">WAVERLEY NOVELS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By WALLACE BRUCE.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>When Walter Scott, one morning before breakfast, while
looking for fishing-tackle, came upon his long neglected manuscript
of Waverley, and decided to publish it, he baited his hook,
so to speak, with a plump literary angle-worm, and carefully
concealing himself, dropped it cautiously into one of the quiet
and almost stagnant pools which here and there break the flow
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Not to carry the figure further he wakes up one morning to
find the “Author of Waverley” famous; but no one knew <i>who</i>
the “Author of Waverley” was. Romances, relating alike to the
history of Scotland, England, France, Switzerland and Palestine,
covering a wide range of life and character, with a varied
record of eight hundred years, followed each other so rapidly
that the reading world opened its eyes in wonder, until the
“great unknown” was finally regarded the “great magician.”
His books, as they came wet from the press, were literally devoured
by the story-loving people of England and Scotland;
and packages, shipped across the Atlantic, were regarded the
most valuable part of the cargo. I have heard elderly people
of New England speak of anxiously waiting for the next ship
which was to bring to their hands a new novel by the “Author
of Waverley.” Never before had the pen of any man awakened
such responsive interest in his own generation. The publication
of Waverley marked a new era in romantic literature.</p>

<p>During the eighty years that have followed that publication
mankind has had its hopes, longings, ambitions and jealousies
mirrored in works of fiction. Hundreds, ay, thousands of
novels—most of them unworthy of their high lineage—have
contended with each other for the world’s approbation; writers
without number have flooded the century with romance; but
through all these years Walter Scott stands the acknowledged
master, the purest-hearted, the noblest-minded of them all;
the man who could say upon his death-bed: “I have not written
one line which I would wish blotted.”</p>

<p>No words of re-invitation are necessary to those who have
once read the pages of Sir Walter, but it will be a “consummation
devoutly to be wished” if I can turn the coming generation
of your readers away from the sickly sentiment of the day to
the works of him, whose influence, like that of King Arthur of
the Round Table, inspires the soul with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“High thoughts and amiable words,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And courtliness, and the desire of fame,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And love of truth, and all that makes a man.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some years ago, while preparing a lecture on “The
Landmarks of Scott,” I found myself confronted with
twenty-six novels and five well-known poems, besides innumerable
essays and histories, all demanding at least a passing
word. I saw that two minutes devoted to each would more than
fill my lecture hour, and leave no room for the frame-work, viz:
Loch Katrine, Loch Lomond, the Trosachs, Melrose, Edinboro,
the Yarrow, the Ettrick, the Tweed, and the Border Country,
where the Percy and the Douglas fought. It then occurred to
me that Scott had unconsciously prepared a panoramic history
of Europe from the time of the Crusades to the year 1812.
Acting upon this suggestion I examined the novels and poems
and found to my great delight, that with here and there an absent
link of fifty or a hundred years the chain was almost perfect.
I condensed the prominent features of eight hundred
years, tracing their connection with Scott’s graphic pictures into
a pen-sketch of ten minutes, and I have been gratified to see
that this idea of chronological order has been recently followed
by one of the leading New York publishers. It is my object in
a series of articles to elaborate this historical sequence from the
time of “Count Robert of Paris” (1094) down to “St. Ronan’s
Well” (1812), and to point out in passing some of the beauties
of the great author.</p>

<p>If the reader of these articles will follow with me the romances
to which I refer, I think he will say, at the close of the series,
that he has found in the Waverley Novels a vivid picture of the
events and customs of Europe, from the days of the crusades
down to a time within the memory of men still living. M.
Augustin Thierry, one of the most philosophical essayists of
France, has eloquently said: “There are scenes of such simplicity,
of such living truth, to be found, that notwithstanding
the distance of the period in which the author places himself,
they can be realized without effort. It is because in the midst
of the world which no longer exists, Walter Scott always places
the world which does, and always will exist; that is to say, human
nature, of which he knows all the secrets. Everything
peculiar to the time and place, the exterior of men, and aspect
of the country and of the habitations, costumes and manners,
are described with the most minute truthfulness; and yet the
immense erudition, which has furnished so many details, is
nowhere to be perceived. Walter Scott seems to have for the
past that second sight, which, in times of ignorance, men attributed
to themselves for the future. To say that there is more
real history in his novels on Scotland and England than in the
philosophically false compilations, which still possess that great
name, is not advancing anything strange in the eyes of those
who have read and understood “Old Mortality,” “Waverley,”
“Rob Roy,” the ”Fortunes of Nigel,” and the “Heart of Mid
Lothian.”</p>

<p>Allison says in his essay on Chateaubriand, published in
<i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, March, 1832: “We feel in Scott’s characters
that it is not romance, but real life which is represented.
Every word that is said, especially in the Scotch novels, is nature
itself. Homer, Cervantes, Shakspere, and Scott, alone have
penetrated to the deep substratum of character, which, however
disguised by the varieties of climate and government, is at
bottom everywhere the same; and thence they have found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
responsive echo in every human heart. He has carried romance
out of the region of imagination and sensibility into the walks
of actual life. He has combined historical accuracy and romantic
adventure with the interest of tragic events; we live
with the heroes, and princes, and paladins of former times, as
with our own contemporaries; and acquire from the splendid
coloring of his pencil such a vivid conception of the manners
and pomp of the feudal ages, that we confound them, in our
recollections, with the scenes which we ourselves have witnessed.
The splendor of their tournaments, the magnificence of their
dress, the glancing of their arms, their haughty manners, daring
courage, and knightly courtesy; the shock of their battle-steeds,
the splintering of their lances, the conflagration of their castles,
are brought before our eyes in such vivid colors, that we are at
once transported to the age of Richard and Saladin, of Charles
the Bold and Philip Augustus.”</p>

<p>The four novels, which deal with the history of the Crusades,
are “Count Robert of Paris,” “The Betrothed,” “The Talisman,”
and “Ivanhoe.” It is a singular fact that the one occupying
the first place in chronological order was written last, and
hardly completed by the author when he died. “Ivanhoe” is,
without doubt, the great favorite. I have often thought that
“Ivanhoe” bears the same relation to Scott’s novels that “The
Merchant of Venice” does to the dramas of Shakspere. “Old
Mortality,” and “Hamlet,” may show deeper insight; but neither
Scott nor Shakspere ever surpassed the two I have associated in
dramatic interest. The three novels which precede “Ivanhoe”
in point of time will give us a complete knowledge of the times
and manners of the Crusades, and lead us, as it were, from one
picture-gallery to another, until we come to the master-piece of
the great artist.</p>

<p>“Count Robert of Paris” opens with a description of the
court of Alexius Commenus—a wily monarch, who had ample
need of all his strategy in dealing with foes that menaced him
from every side: the Franks from the west, the Turks from the
east, the Scythians from the north, the Saracens from the south.
The wealthy city on the Bosphorous, enriched by the spoils of
nations, whose golden gate symbolized the wealth and magnificence
of seven hundred years of prosperity, was on the great
highway of travel, where, so to speak, the “cross-roads” of
Europe met, and presented a tempting prize to the restless and
barbarous hordes from the shores of the Caspian to the German
Ocean. “The superb successor of the earth’s mistress,” decked
in borrowed splendor, gave early intimations of that speedy
decay to which the whole civilized world, then limited within
the Roman Empire, was internally and imperceptibly tending.
Intrigue and corruption in the palace had compelled the Greek
sovereigns of Constantinople, for many years, to procure foreign
soldiers to quell insurrections and defend any traitorous attempt
on the imperial person. These were known as Verangians—a
word signifying barbarians—and formed a corps of satellites
more distinguished for valor than the famed Prætorian Bands
of Rome.</p>

<p>The second chapter of the book reveals the hatred and jealousy
existing between these foreign soldiers and the crafty
civilians. The Verangian, to whom the reader is introduced, is
an Anglo-Saxon too proud to bow his head to a Norman conqueror,
a wanderer from his father-land, a soldier in search of
better fortune, soon to discover by lucky chance among the
crusaders the fair Bertha of his early love. Upon this slender
thread the novelist hangs the romantic elements of the story.
But Count Robert of Paris is in no sense a love drama; in fact
it can hardly be termed a romance. It is rather a historic
sketch, placing in sharp contrast the wild enthusiasm of western
Europe, her castles of rude masonry, her mud hovels, her rude
simplicity, with the over-refined manners and tapestried chambers
of the eastern court hastening to its decay. It is living
Europe confronting the dead centuries.</p>

<p>The third chapter introduces us to a richly furnished drawing
room, where the Princess Anna Commena—the first lady historian—sits
reading to a sleepy group her prolix history of the
glory of her father’s reign. At this gathering Scott brings together
with great art all the leading actors of the drama; the
Emperor Alexius and his wife Irene; Nicepherous Briennius,
the intriguing son-in-law, husband of the fair historian; the
crafty philosopher Agelastes; Achilles Tatius, master of the
guards, and the faithful Verangian. This is the real commencement
of the story, and to this gathering the news is
announced of another body of the great Crusade, consisting not
of the ignorant or of the fanatical like those led on by Peter
the Hermit, but an army of lords and nobles marshaled by
kings and emperors. Against this mass of steel-clad warriors
the East had no power to oppose save the inherent cunning
and strategy of Commenus. Craft and wealth meet stupidity
and avarice. The more powerful chiefs of the Crusades are
loaded with presents, feasted by the emperor with the richest
delicacies, and their thirst slaked with iced wine; while their
followers are left at a distance in malarial districts, and intentionally
supplied with adulterated flour, tainted provisions, and
bad water. Neglected by friends and insulted by foes, they
contracted diseases and died in great numbers “without having
once seen a foot of the Holy Land, for the recovery of which
they had abandoned their peace, their competence, and their
native country. Their misfortunes were imputed to their own
wilfulness, and their sickness to the vehemence of their own
appetites for raw fruits and unripened wines.” By promises of
wealth and long-practiced arts of diplomacy, the Emperor
Commenus at last even induces the leaders of the crusade individually
to acknowledge him—the Grecian Emperor—originally
lord paramount of all these regions, as their liege
lord and suzerain.</p>

<p>Scott takes advantage of this historical fact to draw one of his
matchless pictures, which in color and incident rivals the best
pages of his more dramatic romances; and it is here that Count
Robert, when the emperor left his throne for a single moment,
dismounted from his horse, took the seat of royal purple, and
indolently began to caress a large wolf-hound, which had followed
him, and which, feeling as much at ease as his master,
reposed its grim form on the carpets of gold and silk damask
which tapestried the imperial footstool. It was a picture of
modern liberty looking worn-out despotism in the face. That
sublime audacity revealed the mettle of the race which was to
make individual conscience supreme; and his haughty and
fearless speech was the prologue of Magna Charta, the Bill of
Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. We must pass
over the meeting in the garden of Agesilaus, the entertainment
at the palace, the drugged cup, the dungeon experience of the
count, and his miraculous release, the fortitude and virtue of
his Countess Brenhilda, the meeting of the Verangian with
Bertha in the garden of the philosopher, the treachery of
Briennius, his imprisonment and death-decree, and many other
incidents of interest, for the remaining space of this article
must be given to a brief consideration of “The Betrothed;” but
the reader will be happy to know that, after the conquest of
Jerusalem, Count Robert of Paris returned to Constantinople <i>en
route</i> to his native kingdom. Upon reaching Italy the marriage
of the Verangian and Bertha was celebrated in princely style;
and on his return to England a large district, adjacent to the
New Forest, near the home of his ancestors, was conferred upon
him by William Rufus, where it is presumed they spent their
declining years in peace and happiness.</p>

<p>“The Betrothed” opens with the year 1187—the time of the
Third Crusade—when Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury,
preached the crusade from castle to castle, from town to town,
awaking the inmost valleys of his native Cambria with the call
to arms for the recovery of the Holy Sepulcher. As a connecting
link between the stories we will say that the soldiers of
the First Crusade, after years of hardship and suffering, at last
accomplished their vows. Antioch and Jerusalem yielded to
their arms, the Holy Sepulcher was redeemed from infidels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Those who returned to their homes recounted their triumphs,
and all Europe was aglow with new zeal. Forty-five years later,
in the year 1142, a Second Crusade was organized against the
impending dangers which threatened Palestine and Jerusalem.
The warlike West was again in arms; but this crusade was more
unfortunate than the first. The crusaders were again compelled
to endure the outrages and perfidies of the Greek. As in the
First Crusade, the Christian armies dragged in their train a great
number of children, women, and old men, who could do nothing
toward victory but greatly augmented the disaster of defeat.
The piety and heroism of the First Crusade had degenerated
into a love of show and military splendor. “That which was
still more injurious to discipline,” to quote from the admirable
“History of the Crusades,” by J. F. Michaud, “was the depravity
of manners in the Christian army, which must be principally
attributed to the great number of women that had taken arms
and mixed in the ranks of the soldiery. In this crusade there
was a troop of Amazons, commanded by a general, whose dress
was much more admired than her courage,” and whose gilded
boots procured her a name which we will not copy from the
historian’s pages. Forty years of struggle pass away in Palestine,
and at the time of the opening of our story Henry the
Second of England, Richard the First, and Philip of France,
determine on renewing the Holy War. Moved by the eloquence
and enthusiasm of Baldwin, there is a general cessation of
hostilities between the Welsh princes and their warlike neighbors
on the Marches of England. But one castle, known as
the Garde Doloureuse, was not so fortunate. Its owner was
Raymond Berenger. The hand of his daughter was asked in
marriage by one of the Welsh chieftains. The compliment was
declined. Raymond Berenger, in accordance with a rash
promise, gave battle upon the plain and was slain. The castle
was assaulted, but faithfully defended by an honest Fleming,
inspired by the heroism of the orphaned daughter. Before the
battle, Scott gives us a fine picture of the Welsh bards, and an
admirable idea of life in the mountain fastnesses of Wales.
His description of the defense of the castle is so graphic that
we seem to walk the ramparts with the soldiers, and listen to
the counsel of its defenders. Hugo De Lacy, Constable of
Chester, arrives in time to raise the siege of the castle, and at
once lays siege to the heart of the fair Eveline, to whom it seems
she had been promised, when a child, by her father. From a
sense of duty, rather than love, she accepts his proposal. She
visits her Saxon aunt—a cruel and demented relic of the house
of Baldringham; and is compelled to sleep in a haunted chamber,
known as the “Room of the Red Finger.” The picture of
Saxon life here presented is in strong contrast with the life of
the Norman nobles. The century that had followed the Norman
invasion of England had irritated wounded pride. Overcome
by superstition and terror, Eveline sees in her dreams the spectre,
and hears the fatal couplet, which gives name to the romance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Widowed wife and married maid,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Betrothed, betrayer, and betrayed.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Eveline goes from her aunt’s to the abbess of a convent, a
near relative, and Hugo De Lacy, having signified his intention
of going to the Holy Land, asks a remission of his vow for two
years; but the rigid prelate Baldwin was inexorable: “The
advancement of the crusade was the chief business of Baldwin’s
life, and the liberation of the Holy Sepulcher from the
infidels was the unfeigned object of all his exertions. The successor
of the celebrated Becket had neither the extensive views,
nor the aspiring spirit of that redoubted personage; but on the
other hand, saint as the latter had become, it may be questioned
whether, in his professions for the weal of christendom, he was
half so sincere as was the present archbishop.”</p>

<p>The interview between De Lacy and Baldwin shows the great
power of the Church in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. He
was compelled to leave Eveline before wedlock had united them
indissolubly, and the first line of the couplet:
“Widowed wife and married maid,” seemed already in the
course of fulfillment. Hugo de Lacy sets sail for Palestine with
these good-by words: “If I appear not when three years are
elapsed let the Lady Eveline conclude that the grave holds De
Lacy, and seek out for her mate some happier man. She can
not find one more grateful, though there are many who better
deserve her.”</p>

<p>Eveline returns to the castle of her father; the care of the
country against Welsh invasion is assigned to Damian de Lacy,
who had already by acts of bravery won the esteem of Eveline.
The days and months of indolent castle life wear slowly away,
with the occasional visit of a strolling harper, or a hawking
expedition near the castle, which Scott, with his love for out-door
amusements, enters into with apparent relish. On one of
these excursions Eveline is made prisoner by a party of Welsh
soldiers, and she is led away blindfolded through the recesses
of the hills. She is rescued by Damian de Lacy, who however
is seriously wounded, and taken against the advice of friends
to the castle. Unfounded rumors poison the minds of the people,
the castle is attacked by the king’s forces, led on by a
traitor of Hugo’s family. Damian is taken prisoner and condemned
to death. More than three years had passed away,
and now Hugo returns in poverty, and completely broken in
spirit. Damian is released, and Hugo waives his claim to the
hand of Eveline, and Damian wins one of the noblest women
that Scott has made immortal in the world. So much for the
brief outline of the story, which reveals the manner of life on
the Welsh borders during the time of the Third Crusade. The
two novels which follow, “The Talisman” and “Ivanhoe,” portray
even in more vivid colors the sufferings of the crusaders in
Palestine, and the every day life of Merrie England.</p>

<h3>CLASS OF 1883.</h3>


<p>A special dispensation of weather seemed to have been prepared
for the accommodation of the second graduating class
of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle on Saturday.
A bright warm day was benevolently shaded and cooled by
nature’s great sunshade of cloud during all the out-door exercises,
and promptly upon the entry of the multitude under the
cover of the Amphitheater it began to rain to still further cool
the air. Everything was opportune, and the surroundings
faultless.</p>

<p>The management terrestrial was equally good. There were
four different processions, in five divisions, moving from different
rendezvous in the grounds and converging and articulating
with each other. Each of them started on time “to a tick,” got
to and dropped into place, and everything moved with the
smoothness and precision of a well-adjusted machine. The
program, as prepared, was carried out to the letter and second.</p>

<p>The attendance was as immense, the feeling as good as the
day and management. The unprecedented crowd of the night
before was augmented in the morning by boat-loads and train-loads,
and when the signal-bells for beginning the day’s movement
sounded the avenues were thronged.</p>

<p>Punctually at the hour the “Guard of the Gate,” H. S. Field,
J. J. Covert, Miss E. E. Tuttle, W. H. Rogers, Charles B. Wood,
S. J. M. Eaton, Miss Myrtie Hudson, A. M. Martin, J. G. Allen,
A. M. Mattison, and the “Guard of the Grove,” Miss Annie E.
Wilcox, A. Wilder, Miss M. F. Wells, Miss E. Irvin, Miss
Eleanor O’Connell, E. C. Norton, Mrs. E. Howe, De Forest
Temple, Mrs. Isaiah Golding, George Seebrick, in charge of
Marshal S. J. M. Eaton, formed at the cottage of Lewis Miller
(Auditorium), the right resting on Hedding Avenue.</p>

<p>The keys of the Golden Gate having been delivered by President
Miller to the Messenger, Rev. A. H. Gillet, the division
marched up Hedding Avenue to Clark, and out Clark to the
Hall of Philosophy, and were distributed to their proper positions
in charge of the inclosure of St. Paul’s Grove.</p>

<p>The second division, consisting of fifty-two little girls, the
youngest, Jennie Templeton, four years of age, heading the
procession, beautifully garlanded and bearing artistic baskets
laden with flowers to their very brim, conducted by Mrs. Frank
Beard, superintendent, assisted by Miss M. E. Bemis, Miss
Minnie Barney, Messrs. Garret E. Ryckman, and W. H. Burroughs,
and Miss Blanche Shove, was formed at the Children’s
Temple, the right resting on Clark Avenue. The “Society of
the Hall in the Grove,” (the graduates of the class of 1882, C.
L. S. C.) were thus escorted by this beautiful company of prospective
Chautauquans through Clark Avenue to Hedding, down
Hedding to Simpson, through Simpson to Park Athenæum,
through Park Athenæum to Lake Avenue, to Dr. Vincent’s
cottage.</p>

<p>The sixth division, consisting of the graduates of the class of
1883, and the graduates of the class of 1882, who had not last
year passed through the Golden Gate, and under the Arches,
met at the gate of St. Paul’s Grove, on Merrill Avenue, each
provided with a ticket, a garnet badge, and a copy of the commencement
service. A portion of the Guard of the Grove stood
within the gate, and a portion stood in waiting without. The
Messenger stood at the portal, holding the keys of the gate.
The Guard of the Gate took their places in order, near the
Messenger, while the leaders of the graduating class, Rev. H.
C. Farrar, chairman, and Rev. George C. Wilding, took their
stations, one on the right and the other on the left of the gateway,
that at a given signal the class might read responsively
the form of service provided. The classes were arranged in
parallel columns stretching from the portal itself to the middle of
Miller Avenue, a block and a half.</p>

<p>At precisely 9:45 the Chautauqua Band, headed by Frank
Wright, Marshal, marching up Lake Avenue, reached the cottage
of Dr. Vincent. Here the banner of the C. L. S. C., with
the “Guard of the Banner,” Mrs. M. Bailey and Mrs. Delos
Hatch, were escorted to their places in the line. Four little
children, Chippie Firestone, Edna McClellan, Nellie Mallory
and Bobbie Davenport were conducted to their places as
“streamer bearers,” while the beautiful fabric itself was borne
by Mr. W. E. H. Massey and Mr. Will Butler. The Superintendent
of Instruction, Dr. Vincent, took his place in the line.</p>

<p>The procession took its order of march, moving through Lake
Avenue to Haven Avenue, and up Haven to the Hall of
Philosophy, which it entered, and the band departed to escort
thither “The Chautauqua Procession.” (Division V.) This
division formed at the Hotel Athenæum, Frank Wright, Marshal,
the right resting on the north main front of the hotel, in
the following order:</p>

<div class="center">
<b>Band.</b><br />

Chautauqua Board of Trustees, led by Lewis Miller, Esq., President.<br />

The Faculty and Students of the “Chautauqua School of Languages,” J. H. Worman, Marshal.<br />

The Normal Alumni, carrying their banners for the various years since 1874, Frank Beard, Marshal.<br />

The members of the classes of the C. L. S. C. for the years 1887, 1886, 1885, 1884, Mr. Copeland, Marshal.<br />

The guests of the Assembly, Rev. Frank Russell, Marshal.<br />
</div>

<p>The procession, thus constituted, moved at ten o’clock from
the piazza of the Hotel Athenæum, across the north side of the
Park Athenæum, to Lake Avenue, out Lake Avenue to Cookman
Avenue, up Cookman to Clark, halting on Cookman, the
right resting on Clark, in open order, the Hall of Philosophy
being on its right flank.</p>

<p>At this time the entire neighborhood of the “Hall in the
Grove” was filled with interested crowds of spectators, whose
eyes saw for the second time the “Recognition Services” of the
immense class in the “People’s University.”</p>

<p>More than a hundred and fifty of the “Society of the Hall in
the Grove” (graduates of the preceding year), entered the Hall,
and were seated in its western side.</p>

<p>Precisely at ten o’clock, as the booming of the great bell at
the Point indicated the hour, the members of the Class of 1883,
with such members of the Class of 1882 as had not last year
passed the Arches, standing at the gate of St. Paul’s Grove, read
responsively the devotional services, Rev. George C. Wilding
acting as precentor of the first section, and Rev. H. C. Farrar
as the precentor of the second section.</p>

<p>The “Messenger,” Rev. A. H. Gillet, in slow and solemn utterance
gave the announcement as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I come to inform all candidates for enrollment in the “Society of the
Hall in the Grove” that the hour appointed for your reception has arrived;
the Hall has been set in order; the Path through the Grove has
been opened; the Arches under which you must pass have been erected;
the Key which will open this Gate has been placed in my hands. And
to you who, as members of the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle</span>, have completed the four years’ Course of Reading, and now
hold in your hands a pledge of the same, I extend, in the name of the
authorities, a welcome into St. Paul’s Grove, under the First Arch—and
let the watchman guard carefully the Gate.</p></div>

<p>After the announcement by the Messenger, he turned and
opened the gate. The first to enter was Mr. Miner Curtis, an
invalid, borne in a wheeled carriage by the advance members
of the class of ’83, and accompanied by his wife and son, who
were graduates of last year.</p>

<p>Having entered the Gate, and the Gate having been closed,
the class proceeded very slowly toward the Hall, passing the
second and third Arches. As they walked up the beautifully
decorated way, the “Choir of the Hall in the Grove” stationed
at the fourth Arch, and led by Prof. C. C. Case, sang “A Song
of To-day:”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Sing peans over the Past!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We bury the dead years tenderly.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the entrance to the Hall stood the Superintendent of Instruction
to welcome the coming class, and as they passed by
the Arch nearest the Hall, the fifty-two little girls standing in
double columns, scattered the way of the coming graduates
with the beauteous flowers, emblematic of the flower-strewn
paths of intellectual light which they may hope to tread in the
coming years.</p>

<p>On entering the building the “Society of the Hall in the
Grove” received their brothers and sisters with the most marked
tokens of good cheer, waving their handkerchiefs and vocally
expressing the kindly feeling of the seniors of the year agone.</p>

<p>At precisely 10:20 the “C. L. S. C. Glee Club,” Prof. W. F.
Sherwin, conductor, led the classes (which filled the Hall to
repletion), as they sang</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A sound is thrilling thro’ the trees</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And vibrant thro’ the air.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the reading of the responsive services came the “Recognition,”
by the Superintendent of Instruction, Dr. J. H. Vincent,
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>Fellow Students of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle of the Class of 1883:</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearly Beloved</span>—You have finished the appointed and
accepted course of reading. You have been admitted to this
sacred Grove. You have passed the Arches dedicated to
“Faith,” “Science,” “Literature” and “Art.” You have entered
in due form this Hall, the center of the Chautauqua Literary and
Scientific Circle; and now, as Superintendent of Instruction, in
behalf of my associates, the counselors, who are this day absent,
I greet you, and hereby announce that you, and your
brothers and sisters absent from us this day, who have completed
with you the prescribed course of reading, are accepted
and approved graduates of the “Chautauqua Literary and
Scientific Circle,” and that you are entitled to membership in
the “Society of the Hall in the Grove.” The Lord bless and
keep thee; the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and
be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace.</p>

<p>I may say on behalf of the only counselor who is on the
ground, Dr. Lyman Abbott, that his indisposition renders it
unsafe for him to be here, but at my cottage he will join the
procession, and go with you to the Amphitheater. We will now
unite in singing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Bright gleams again Chautauqua’s wave,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And green her forest arches.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>During the singing of the ode, according to the direction of
the Superintendent of Instruction, the class of 1882, under the
marshalship of W. A. Duncan, quietly marched from the Hall
in double column, taking their position on Haven, Clark, and
Cookman avenues, that the graduating class might pass through
their ranks at the close of the service of recognition.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of Instruction, Dr. Vincent, Lewis
Miller, the Messenger, the Secretary of the C. L. S. C., preceded
by the children (flower bearers) and the Banner of the C. L. S.
C., headed the procession, which passed out of the south side
of the Hall, around Clark to Cookman Avenue, and passed
down through the opened ranks of the classes of the C. L. S. C.,
from whom they received constant marks of recognition and
affection, the classes in some cases waving their Chautauqua
salute to the Chief as he passed by.</p>

<p>When the head of the procession reached the cottage of Dr.
Vincent, a halt was made for a few moments, during which Dr.
Lyman Abbott, one of the counselors of the C. L. S. C., and
the orator of the day, took his place in the ranks.</p>

<p>As the procession marched up the long walk to the north
door of the Amphitheater, immense throngs filled all the available
standing room on the slopes of the ravine, and the
“Blooming of the Lilies” (the Chautauqua salute) was given by
all the opened ranks of the classes as the head of the procession
passed through.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua Band, stationed at the entrance of the north
gate, discoursed sweet music during the passage of the long
<i>cortege</i>.</p>

<p>All the officers, invited guests, members of the board of
Chautauqua trustees, officers and members of the Chautauqua
School of Languages, the Normal Alumni, and the various
classes of the C. L. S. C., passed into the great Amphitheater,
when the ropes were dropped, and sooner than we write it, all
the remaining seating space was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>The platform was filled with distinguished Chautauquans and
others; the organ gave forth its sweet harmonies under the
manipulation of Prof. Andrews; the Chautauqua Banner of the
C. L. S. C. was stationed in full view of the vast throng; and
after the devotional exercises Dr. Vincent introduced Dr. Lyman
Abbott, who delivered the Commencement oration, as
follows:</p>


<h3>THE DEMOCRACY OF LEARNING.</h3>

<p><i>Fellow Chautauquans:</i>—I see in some of your eyes triumph.
You have run in four years a race with uncertainty
whether you could ever reach the goal. You have carried on
your work under difficulties and discouragements, such as are
never known to him who has perfect and continual leisure for
the pursuit of studies; but in the midst of employments which
were incessant and imperative in their demands upon you; and
your courage, your patience, your hope, have vanquished the
obstacles, and you are here to-day to receive the outward sign
and symbol of your inward victory. In other eyes I see expectation.
You have commenced a course and you are hopeful of
achieving a result, which has been made possible to you within
the last few years, that the fruits and results of study might be
yours though you could not give yourself to a life of study, still
less to the persistent and professional pursuit of scholarship.
In other eyes I see desire dimmed by fear and doubt; you do
not know whether this great realm is open to you or not; you
wish that you could be assured that it is. Is this all a mistake?
Is your triumph a false one, your expectation a delusive one,
your hope and your desire one impossible of attainment? This
is so asserted. There are not a few in our times who are of the
opinion that learning is of necessity only for the few, or at all
events if the many can enter a little upon the realm, they must
always live upon the border and never can enter into the heart
of the country.</p>

<p>I desire, if I may this morning, to meet and to answer this
objection of skepticism, and to show that learning is within the
possible reach to-day of the great body of industrious, hard-working,
perplexed, and driven people of America; that it is
not the privilege of the few; that it is the prerogative of the
many. I desire to show you that we are entering into an epoch
which I may call the “Democracy of Learning.” We have
already entered into the epoch of democracy in religion. The
time has gone by, at least for all Protestant people, of believing
that religion is for the few, or that even the higher and larger
privileges of religious life are for the few. It has been established
for all those who believe in an open Bible and in the
universal religion of Jesus Christ that the innermost sanctuary
of the temple is for every one. The great wall that before
separated the court of Israel from the court of the priests
has been broken down; there is but one court. The great veil
that hung between the holy of holies and the court of the priests
has been torn asunder, and every one of us is not only priest
but high-priest, free to enter into the very holy of holies. And
we have entered into the epoch of democracy in public affairs.
The time has gone by when political power belonged to the few,
and political intelligence was believed to be the prerogative of the
few. We have come into an epoch in which political power is
lodged in the hands of the great masses of the people; and
it is lodged there because we believe that, on the whole, political
intelligence is lodged in the hands of the great masses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
people. I desire to show you this morning that we are entering
upon an epoch of the Democracy of Learning, in which the
highest and best fruits of scholarship are also the privilege and
the prerogative of the many. When we have entered upon
that land, then we shall be ready to enter upon the last and the
completest phase of the triumphant democracy, the Democracy
of Industry. Then, when intelligence shall be universally
diffused, and when all men shall have the power at least of acquiring
the largest and the best and the ripest fruits of knowledge
and of intelligence, we shall come into that epoch in
which no longer the few will control the industries of the many,
but in which industry will be the controlling power, and wealth
will be its servant.</p>

<p>I have a three-fold object this morning—I desire in the first
place to show you that the fruits of learning are fruits which
hang on the lower boughs of the tree where we may all pluck
them; to show you not only that, but that the ripest and the
best fruits of learning hang there. I desire to show you that it
is not necessary that men should go through a college course
and should have four years of leisure and of quiet for college
study in order to reap the best fruits of a college education.
The <i>process</i> of investigation must always be carried on by the
few. The <i>results</i> of education may be, yea! are already becoming
the property of the many. Only a few explorers can
bear the perils of the Arctic Sea and investigate the mystery of
the North Pole; but we can all have the fruits of their investigation.
Only a few men can labor and toil in the great libraries
searching out the course and progress of history and its
sacred events, but we can all have the garnered fruits of their
toil and their industry. Not only may we pluck a single blossom,
and here and there a single half-ripened fruit from this
tree; but the ripest, the best, that which has hung the longest
in the sun-light, that whose cheeks are painted the most rosy
red, and whose heart has in it the most saccharine juice, that
is ready to-day to fall into our open palm if we will but extend
it.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to show you this, I shall also necessarily ask
you to consider with me what are the ripest and best fruits of
learning. What is the object of education? It is not an end, it is a
means to an end. It is a great pity that our colleges do not
understand this better; for if they did better comprehend that
education is a means, and that the end lies behind, fewer students
would come out with empty diplomas when the college
course is ended.</p>

<p>And incidentally I shall hope also to answer one argument
which is sometimes used, and oftener, I think, lies secretly in
the minds of people, against a popular and universal education.
Some satirist has said that “Ignorance is the mother of devotion.”
If that were true, we might well doubt whether universal
education is worth the price we should have to pay for
it. If it were true that God held out in one hand devotion to
us and in the other hand education, and said, “You must
choose between these two; if you become educated you must
be skeptical, if you would be devoted you must remain ignorant”—it
would be a difficult question for most of us to decide
whether we would have intelligence without piety or piety without
intelligence. I shall show you that it is not learning, but a
little learning which is a dangerous thing; and that if our work
is thorough, the broader the culture, the profounder the piety.</p>

<p>For our purpose this morning, learning may be divided into
four provinces: literature, history, science and philosophy, to
which must be added in any complete topography of the realm,
pure mathematics. By pure mathematics I mean arithmetic,
algebra, geometry, logarithms, the calculus and the like. But
pure mathematics is simply an instrument by which the scientific
mind reaches certain results. I shall not therefore consider
this department at all; it is not necessary for our purpose.
Some one must look through the telescope, some one must
know how to use the spectroscope in order to tell us what is the
size of the sun and its constituent elements; but we do not need
to examine the telescope or the spectroscope. Some one must
be skilled in pure mathematics in order to tell us how many
miles the sun is distant from our own earth, but we may take
the result without going through the process. This instrument
must always be left in the hand of the specialist. I wish to show
you that all that is best, highest and most important in literature,
history, science and philosophy lies within the power of
your acquisition. I wish to show you the spirit with which you
must study, and the purpose with which you must acquire it;
and I wish to show you that if you acquire in that spirit and
with that purpose you can not but gain in your religious nature.</p>

<p>I. In the first place, then, what is literature, and why do we
study it? Literature is the expression of human life, in its innermost
experiences, and in its outward forms. Sometimes
it is the expression of social life, sometimes of the intellectual
life, sometimes of the emotional life; but always and everywhere
literature is a mirror held up either before society or
before the human heart; no, not a mirror, but the sensitized
plate in a photographic apparatus; and the picture, now of
society, now of the brain, now of the palpitating heart with
its fears, hopes, joys and experiences, is given upon the plate;
and literature is the picture brought out for us to examine.
To study literature is not to study language. Language is
merely the instrument which we use for the study of literature.
To study literature is to study life—life in its outward
semblance or life in its inward experiences. It is to study the
life of the community and of society as we study it in Thackeray;
or it is to study the life of the brain and the thought as we
study it in Plato and Bacon; or it is to study the life of the inward
emotions as we study it in Tennyson or Wordsworth.
Now, in order to study life as it is portrayed in literature it is
not necessary to know the original language in which that life
was portrayed. Some one must have studied the Greek language
in order to bring Homer to our intelligence; some one
must have studied Latin and brought Horace within our horizon;
some one must have studied French and brought Molière
within our knowledge; some one must have studied Italian in
order to introduce Dante to our acquaintance; but it is not
necessary for us to do so. Some one must have taken the
negative and printed the picture on the paper for us; but we
need not all be photographers in order to get the picture for
our own enlightenment. I hold a silver dollar in my hand.
Some one must have gone to the mines and dug out the ore
with a pick; some one must have put it under the great stampers
and beaten it out in the stamping mill; some one must have
put it in the sieve and shaken it and shaken it until the grosser
dross was washed away; some one must have put it into the furnace
and heated it until the finer dross was eliminated; some
one must have carried it to the mint and put the stamp of the
United States authority upon it; but we need not all be miners
digging in the mines; we need not all be workers in the stamping
mill; we need not all be toilers in the furnace room; we
need not all be masters or mechanics in the mint. The money
was coined by those who have wrought for us, and to whom our
gratitude is due, but the coin is ours; it is not merely for those
who worked in producing it.</p>

<p>I hold in my hand an extract from Taine which expresses
that which I desire to express better than I can perhaps express
it myself. Let me read it: “What is your first remark on
turning over the great leaves of a folio, the yellow sheets of a
manuscript, a poem, a code of laws, a confession of faith?
This, you say, did not come into existence all alone, it is but a
mould like a fossil-shell, an imprint, like one of the shapes embossed
in stone by an animal which lived and perished. Under
the shell there was an animal; and behind the document
there was a man. Why do you study the shell, except to bring
before you the animal? So you study the document only to
know the man. The shell and the document are lifeless wrecks,
valuable only as a clue to the entire and living existence. We
must get hold of this existence and endeavor to re-create it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is a mistake to study the document as if it were isolated. This
were to treat things as a simple scholar, to fall into the error of
the bibliomaniac.”</p>

<p>You do not need to have traversed the ocean beach or climbed
the mountain-top and gathered the shells; you may go into the
museum where they have already been gathered, and study
their history there. You do not need, with dictionary and grammar,
to work out the secrets of the language; you may take the
products of those who have thus wrought, and learn the man
that lies behind the document.</p>

<p>Not only is it not necessary that a man should study language
in order to study literature; in innumerable cases the study of
the language has absolutely interfered with the study of the
literature. In innumerable cases, men at college have ground
away, day after day, and month after month, and year after
year, over cases and nouns and parts of speech, and rules of
syntax and rules of grammar—working only at the grammar,
and utterly oblivious of the great light that lay behind it. Mr.
Adams, of Massachusetts, has recently told us how hard a man
may study Greek and how little he may know of it after he gets
through with it, for he assures us that he does not know the
Greek alphabet to-day, although he studied Greek six years, four
years before college and two in it. I confess I should not have
thought it possible for a man to have studied so much and yet
know so little when he got through; but I am very certain
of this, that my own experience reflects the experience of
many college students. I learned more of Homer—of his
life, of his character, of the lessons he has to teach, of the
man himself—from reading in the “Ancient Classics for English
Readers,” the Iliad and the Odyssey, and from reading
Bryant’s translation, than I ever received from reading Homer
himself in the original Greek in my college class. That which
is highest, and supremest, and best in literature, you may
obtain without a college education. You may learn the life,
you may learn the man, you may learn the sacred truth;
and you can not do that without broadening your sympathies
and developing your charity. When you have read
Homer and Virgil and Horace; when you have read Dante
and Milton; when you have read Molière and Shakspere;
when you have read Wordsworth and Tennyson, and when,
out of all this reading, you have gathered their fruits, you will
find this to be true, that, though you have one picture of
Greek life, one of Italian life, one of French life, one of
English life, one portraying the life of four centuries before
Christ, and one portraying the life of eighteen centuries after;
yet in all these languages, in all these epochs, in all these civilizations
the great heart of hope and joy and love and fear and
reverence and faith was one. And you will learn to know that
humanity, in all its nationalities, in all its epochs, in all its civilizations,—aye,
and under all the varied forms of its religions,
true and false—that humanity is one in all its brotherhood, and
one in its great Father in heaven.</p>

<p>II. What is the object of studying history? What is history?
It is not a mere record of dates, not the mere annals of actions,
not merely the account of what men have performed
or what nations have wrought. A man does not know history
because he can recite glibly, beginning with Alfred the Great
and coming down to the present time, the dates of the chief
events and the chief epochs in English history. History is the
record of God’s dealing with the human race. History is the
account of the great laws under which this human race has been
evolved from its lowest condition to its highest condition. As
the tree grows from the seed planted in the ground—first the
little bud peering above the surface, then the stalk, and
then the branches, and by and by the completed oak; as
the child grows from the babe in the cradle, taking on one new
faculty and one power after another till he comes into as yet
incompleted manhood—for the completion of manhood lies afar
off in the dim, distant and invisible future—so the nations of the
earth, and so the whole race of man has been developed from
the seed to the oak and from the babe in the cradle to manhood
in its maturity; and to read history is to read the process of this
development.</p>

<p>What, for example, is English history? To know English
history is to know that in the Bible, way back years and
years before the birth of Christ—fourteen centuries before—were
planted all the seeds of a free representative government;
to know that in the Mosaic statutes is to be found
the outline of a perfect political economy; to know that the
Mosaic commonwealth had in it all the elements of those
institutions which have made America a free nation; popular
suffrage, representative assemblies, political government divided
into three departments, executive, legislative, and judicial;
a carefully framed system of laws, with a carefully framed system
of penalties, a universal system of education, and a religion
that was national. To know history is to know that Alfred the
Great was a devout believer in the Bible as the word of God,
that he studied it and found in this Old Testament, fourteen
centuries before the birth of Christ, these seeds of a free government
buried and forgotten. It is to know that he gathered
them out of this old book, as men have gathered wheat seeds
out of old mummies in the tombs of Egypt, and planted them
in the more fertile soil of an Anglo-Saxon community. It is to
know how the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemote grew to be an English
Parliament; it is to know how the people came to be represented
in it under Simon de Montfort; and how they came to
be supreme in it under Charles the First, and Cromwell. It is to
know how the nation was at first a congeries of conflicting
tribes, partially brought together by Alfred the Great, and consolidated
together under one national sovereignty by William
the Conqueror, and growing thence into unity under successive
statesmen, until these latter days, when William Gladstone, the
greatest statesman of them all, is perfecting the Christian unity
of the empire by Christian justice and equity. It is to know
how, in the earlier history of this nation, the Pope of Rome assumed
authority and control over the nations. It is to know
how, through the centuries, the war went on between the Anglo-Saxon
love of liberty and this claim of the Church of Rome;
how it was begun under Augustine, continued under Thomas à
Becket, brought to the beginning of the end under King Henry
the Eighth, until finally under Elizabeth the bonds that bound
England to Rome were severed forever, and England was made
free from every foreign prince and potentate. It is to know
how this seed—the sovereignty of the people in the nation, the
sovereignty of the nation against the anarchy of feudalism,
and the liberty of the nation against the Pope—grew into a
tree, as yet but a young sapling; it is to know how then
God carefully dug this sapling up, and transported it three
thousand miles across the ocean and planted it in the yet more
fertile soil of America. It is to know that because of the battle
and bloodshed, and the long suffering endured on that soil,
to-day there floats over us the banner of liberty and justice.
The seeds were there in that old Bible, the culture was there in
that English history; the fruit we rejoice in here to-day.</p>

<p>One does not need to work in the Spanish libraries with Prescott,
nor in the Dutch libraries with Motley, nor among the old
manuscripts of the British museum with Froude, nor among the
pamphlets of English literature with Macaulay, in order to gather
for himself these highest and supremest fruits of historical
learning. The processes of historical research must always be
carried on by the few; we must always have in this country
some men who have leisure to pursue them. Alas for us, if the
time ever comes when we grow careless or indifferent respecting
our colleges or universities, and the kind of culture which
they give; but they give culture that the cultured may give us
fruit. The few garner; the heaviest are for all.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible for one thus to study the history of the human
race, to see how, little by little, liberty has grown, education
has grown, humanity has grown, and not grow himself in faith
in an overruling Providence, and in hope in the Supreme God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>As the broad, comprehensive, interior study of literature will
give breadth of sympathy, so the broad, comprehensive, and
large study of history will give hope. When the fog covers the
ocean, and the mariner befogged knows not where he is, and
can not tell whence his course has been, nor where it shall be,
he sometimes goes aloft and from the top-mast, looking above
the fog, discerns the coast in the distance and the entrance into
the harbor. In history we rise out of the fog that environs all
in the lower level; we look above the fog and over it, and know
then the courses we have traced, and see the harbor and the
haven not far before us.</p>

<p>III. What is science, and for what purpose do we study it? I
use, of course, the word science in its restricted sense, meaning
natural science. For two purposes. Nature is a vast and wonderful
machine; its mechanism may well arouse both our astonishment
and our admiration. If you have a watch that
keeps time so that it does not vary more than two or three minutes
in a year you are proud of it, and if you should by chance
have a watch that did not vary more than one minute in a year
you would be a remarkably humble man if you did not boast of
it to your acquaintances. But in the heavens the sun and the
planets round it have been keeping time for the centuries,
and as yet astronomy has not detected an appreciable variation
in its time. What a wonderful mechanism is this! If an inventor
should construct a furnace which would keep us warm
in winter and cool in summer, no manufacturer would be able
to supply the orders. But you have within you a furnace such
that although you may go from the land of the Esquimaux with
the thermometer 40° below zero, to the tropics with the thermometer
110° above zero, this furnace does not allow the habitation
in which you dwell to vary more than four or five degrees.
What a wonderful mechanism is this nature which we
study! And we study this mechanism partly that we may use
it, that we may lay hold on these great forces of nature and
make them subservient to our will by understanding the laws
which regulate and govern them. But nature is more than a
machine; nature is also a book, and a wonderful book, written
all over in hieroglyphics that require study for their apprehension.
It is more than a mechanism. It is a revelation; and
it reveals wondrous things to him who knows how to read it
aright. Edison and Morse, Copernicus and Newton—they have
interpreted nature on the one side; but Wordsworth, and Longfellow,
and Bryant—they have interpreted nature on the other,
and the one class of interpretations is as valuable as the other.
We study nature as a mechanism that we may know how to
use it; we study nature as a book that we may know how to
read it.</p>

<p>Now, all that which is most valuable in nature, as a mechanism,
we lay hold of and use without going through the labor
necessary in the original examination by the first investigator.
We do not need to understand the laws of heat and steam to
use them; some one has learned the laws, and has brought fire
and water together and has pronounced a nuptial blessing over
them, and a child has been born of the marriage, and we take
steam for our slave without knowing the ritual which married
the father and mother. Some one must have learned how to
reach his hand to the cloud, and bring down the electricity,
make it run our errands and serve the purpose of our illumination;
but we do not need to know the processes in order to sit
under the light. Not only is it true that the mechanical
uses that come from natural sciences we get without going
through the processes, but the literary and spiritual we get also.
Others have been turning over the pages of this marvelous book
and have been reading it to us, and unconsciously, unknowingly,
almost without the sense that we have been learning anything,
we have learned great lessons in this book of nature.
Scientists on the one side and theologians on the other
have put science and religion into antagonism with one another.
But they are sister teachers of the race; science has received
all its life from the late comprehended revelation of the first
chapter of Genesis that nature is man’s servant, not his god;
and theology has learned some of its profoundest lessons from
the book of nature which science has interpreted. Consider for
one moment what a fundamental religious lesson we have
learned in the school-room of science almost without knowing
that she was our teacher. The ancient Hebrews believed that
Palestine was the world; all the rest was a mere outlying district
environing it, the back yard as it were. The Mediterranean
was the Great Sea, the little pond of Galilee was the Sea
of Galilee, the sun and moon and stars were torches for man’s
illumination—that was their conception of the universe. With
that conception it is not strange that they had an equally insignificant
and unworthy conception of the God of the world, a
conception against which the inspired writers were continually
struggling, and from which they were continually endeavoring
to lift the people up. When the Philistines fought against the
Israelites and captured the ark of God they were in triumph.
“We have captured God,” they thought; and the Israelites
were almost equally in despair, for they also half thought that
Jehovah had been carried off a prisoner. Now, science, even
more than revelation, has been enlarging our conceptions of
this universe. The Holy Land, a province about as large as
Vermont, is no longer the earth; the Atlantic and the Pacific
are the great seas; this globe on which we live is but one of the
smaller globes of the planetary system; and the great planetary
system itself is but a smaller one of the great planetary systems
which are circling around some vast and distant sun. Science
has taught us too that all this universe is linked together, bound
together by a common law, bound together by a common order
of phenomena. It has investigated the sun and the stars, it has
analyzed their light, it has shown us that the substances of these
bodies are identical with the substances of ours. It has taught
us the unity of nature, it has taught us the vastness of nature.
There are stars in the firmament which you can see with the
naked eye, on which if a man were standing with a telescope
fine enough and powerful enough to see what is transpiring on
this globe, and should look through it to-day, he would see not
this congregation assembled under this roof, but the first outbreaking
of the revolution, so long does it take light to traverse
from our globe to the stars, light that takes but eight minutes to
travel from the sun to the earth. There are stars so distant
that he would see not Chautauqua gathered here to-night, but
the crucifixion of Christ taking place on the hill of Calvary;
stars so distant, that with a telescope powerful enough to carry
the message of this world to his sight, he would see Abraham
coming out of the land of his idolatry into the promised land;
stars so distant that he would see this earth first taking on its
brightness in the birth-day of its glory. So vast is our universe
that the mind can not attempt to comprehend its majestic distances.
It is not theology, it is not religion, it is not even the
Bible that has unfolded this vastness; it is science. It is impossible
that men who have once learned anything of this
greatness of creation, or anything of this unity of creation,
should ever bow down again before idols of wood and stone.
So long as men thought that the laws of the material universe
were antagonistic and anarchic, that the universe was made up
of warring tribes and provinces, so long it was not strange that
they should worship many gods. So long as they thought that
it was a little province on which they lived, the boundaries of
which they could themselves measure with their tape-line, they
might well worship before images they had formed with their
utterances or with their hands. But to-day you might burn
every Bible in the land, you might burn every church and Sunday-school
house, you might put all the priests and ministers in
America on the great bonfire, and consume them as well, and
then you might erase from every mind every lesson that had
been learned from church or Sunday-school, from priest or
minister, and this nation could not go back to idolatry, unless
it went back to the utter barbarism of utter ignorance. That
which is highest and supremest in science you can learn without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
becoming a scientist; and you can not learn it without learning
the large reverence that is the very foundation of religion.</p>

<p>IV. What is philosophy? The study of philosophy is the
study of the laws which govern the spiritual realm, as the study
of natural science is the study of the laws which govern the natural
and the physical realm. It is not studying Hegel, and Kant,
and Schleiermacher; it is not studying Hickock or Hopkins;
it is not studying what philosophers have thought—they are the
mere translators, the mere “ponies.” Philosophy is the law of
humanity, either social or individual. The study of philosophy
is the study of the laws which God has ordained for the binding
of men together into a common organism, or for the government
of their individual lives. Men believed that the foundation
of the State was a compact, and that each citizen gave
up something of his rights for the common welfare; they believed
that the foundation of the Nation was a compact in which
each State gave up something which it had of right to secure
the advantage of a commonwealth. So believing, they concluded
that any State might withdraw from its allegiance, and
they might have easily concluded that any individual might
withdraw from his allegiance. It is only as we learned that
we are born into the government and made a part of the
State from the beginning by the ordinance of God, that
we have learned what is the bond that has bound the nation
together. Revolting from the Romish doctrine that marriage
is a sacrament, Protestantism has been teaching for years that
it is merely a civil contract. We are reaping the result of this
false teaching. To-day in Puritan Connecticut, the minister can
not tie the marriage bond much faster than the courts across
the street can dissolve it. We have yet to learn that marriage
is more than a civil contract, that it is an ordinance of God;
that he who made man and woman made them that these twain
should become one flesh, and made the home to be the first
Church and the first State. When we have learned that, we
shall have learned the foundation of the home as we have learned
the foundation of the State. To study philosophy is to study the
laws which govern society in its organism. All text-books are
only instructions to teach us how to study life itself, which is the
great text-book. To study philosophy is also to study the
laws which govern the individual. It is to know that God has
made you body, soul and spirit; that he has given you a physical
organism, wonderful, but simply a mechanism in your
hands; that he has given you a mental power wonderful in its
reasoning qualities, but with its partial parallels in the animals
about you; it is to know that far above the body and the mind
is the spirit—reverence, and love, and hope, and a living
faith—that makes you one with God, and that points you
to your eternal habitation. This it is to study mental and
moral philosophy. It is to know how to read the secrets of
your own soul. It is to know how to read the inner life of the
souls of others. Books will help; scholarship will help; but the
great book is the human soul, and we need not have scholarship
to read that book. Burns and Shakspere were not great
scholars; but no scholar ever surpassed Burns and Shakspere
in the reading of the human soul.</p>

<p>No one ever exerted so profound an influence on the life of
humanity as Jesus of Nazareth. You may think that Jesus was
simply a man; you will not doubt that from the teachings of
Jesus have gone forth an influence greater by far than went forth
from Plato, or Socrates, or Confucius, or Buddha. You may
think with me that he was the Son of God; you surely will not
doubt the potency of the influence that proceeded from the incarnate
Son of God. Jesus, the son of the carpenter, what did
he know of literature, of science, of philosophy? Rather, what
knowledge did he employ? He was thoroughly familiar with
the literature of his day—that is, the Bible; but he never displayed
or employed any critical or literary knowledge respecting
it. He never discussed questions of authorship, he never debated
questions of origin or date, he did not touch that which lay on the
surface. He read the interior and spiritual truth. He saw in
that which to their mind was a mere annal, and a mere law
the beating heart of the inspired prophet telling of God. He
tore off the wrapping and made the world see it. He plucked
from the psalm of David this bud, “The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want,” and in his hand it blossomed into the parable
of the Good Shepherd. He plucked from the psalm of David
this utterance, “Like as a father pitieth his children,” and in his
hand it blossomed into the parable of the Prodigal Son. He
knew the life back of literature. He invented no machine,
gave no hint of any, suggested no steam engine, no steam boat,
no electric light. What he <i>knew</i> I say not. I may say what he
used, and knowledge of nature as a mechanism he never used;
but he looked into nature as a book, read her teachings, and
interpreted them; in the sower going forth to sow, in the fisher
gathering his fish from his net; in the bird’s song in the air he
heard the sweet note of trust; in the flowers blossoming from
the ground he read the sweet promise of God’s providing care.
Things which men having eyes saw not and ears heard not be
brought to their vision and their hearing. He propounded no
scheme of political philosophy, none of psychology, or theology,
but he taught that “One is your father, even God in heaven,
and ye all are brethren;” and the great laws that are to bind
together, rather the one great law of order, the law of love,
this law he expounded. The son of the carpenter lived
that he might teach, among the other lessons, this lesson of the
democracy of learning; that learning, in its higher and more
valued forms, is for the mechanic busy at his bench, for the
smith grimy with toil at his forge, for the mother busiest of all,
with hands and brain and heart filled with her children.</p>

<p>Kings of the earth have fought that they might hold the
power in their own hands, and the many might be subject to
them. The people have risen, and grown strong, until at last
they have trampled the king and the army under their feet, and
have rushed into the citadel and the palace and taken possession,
and the citadel of oppression and the palace of luxury
have become the temple of liberty. The priests have fought
long that they might keep the people out of the temple and hold
the mysteries of religion an exclusive possession. But the people
have surged up against the priests and trampled them under
foot, and occupied the temple of religion. The temples of
earning are open; the kings of learning stand at the door, and
with their scepters beckon you to come and share their coronation
and their crown. The priests of learning bid you come,
that they may open to you the mysteries of literature. For in the
republic of letters there is no aristocracy but that of service.
And they only are great who have learned how best to serve
their fellow-men.</p>

<p>The triumph that I read in your eyes is not a false triumph.
You have plucked the first fruits, and all the other brightest
and best are before you for your plucking. The expectation
that I read in your eyes is not a delusive expectation. The
fruit is yours. The desire that I read in your eyes is not a cheating
desire. The aspiration that burns within you for learning may
have its gratification. You have no money? Literature is
cheap. You have no time? You have as much time as Schliemann
had, who stood in the long line before the postoffice and
studied his Greek while waiting for the letters. You have as
much time as Mary Somerville had, who wrote the volume
which gave her a princely reputation among astronomers, while
tending with motherly care the children in the nursery pulling at
her skirts. The forces of nature come out of the ground and offer
themselves to you to do the drudgery which aforetime was left
to human hands, that you may have time to learn the truth of
God, and the works of God, and the will of God. We stand to-day
on the mountain height. We look just across the valley.
The Jordan is no longer overflowing its banks, but is a narrow
and shallow stream. The promised land lies there in all its richness
and brilliance, and God’s providence utters its promise to
us Americans in this nineteenth century: “Be strong and of

<p>Another immense audience assembled in the Amphitheater
at two o’clock to listen to the addresses delivered to the graduating
class by President Lewis Miller, and Dr. J. H. Vincent.</p>


<h3>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT LEWIS MILLER.</h3>

<p><i>Chautauquans:</i>—In these days of popular education, it may
be profitable to examine the different sources of culture and
development. First among these are books—the treasures that lie
hidden in them may well awaken our inquiry and admiration,
may well be worth the many hours of toil spent in preparing
the mind, so that it can converse with the masters of the past
and present. I do not wonder at hunger after the hidden
treasures of books, for in them are power, wealth and pleasure.
We need but watch the interested audiences that gather in this
Amphitheater, to realize the power there is in the rostrum,
how in all ages peoples have been confirmed or changed in
their opinions by that mere persuasive power of words. Your
mind now runs over the histories you have studied, and you
recall the orators who, through the power of speech alone, have
revolutionized empires, advanced or checked civilization.
What pleasure to the mind and heart, to be able in our leisure
hours to sit with Herodotus, Macaulay, Motley, Bancroft, and a
host of others, and hear them tell their historic stories! or with
David, Homer, Shakspere, Whittier and Bryant, and let them
fill our minds with the beautiful and soothing words of poetry!
Does not art, in a still more condensed form, give us the history
of the nations of the past? Does it not give us a clearer idea of
thought? What descriptive words could give us so clear a view
of the golden candlestick, around which clusters so much of interest
to the Bible student, as can be had by a look at the plaster
mould of the arch of Titus, in the Museum? What more
rapidly moulds, and more powerfully influences, the present
age than do the pictures on the walls, and the books in the libraries
of our homes?</p>

<p>May I venture to bring before your mind that other phase of
art, known as the mechanic art? That art, on which the educator
has placed so small an estimate that when an apparently
dull boy is found in the school or family, he is turned over to
it, in the notion that stupidity can here find subsistence and
compensation.</p>

<p>Now, give this art the power to express itself in words and in
the fine arts, and I will bring back to you the days of Raphael
and Michael Angelo, in which thought was expressed in words
and on canvas and stone, in such purity that the student in the
schools of to-day is carried back to these times, to study the
perfection and beauty of expression. In the line of a better
educated labor lies the settlement of the great labor question.
Will it be as Garfield suggests, for Chautauqua to provide not
only for the leisure, but secure the leisure by some system of
education that will make it possible?</p>

<p>If by any means the mental energies can be combined with
the muscles, the product of labor will be greatly increased, and
the time producing the same quantity lessened. Struggling
labor hardly sees that in the short space of about thirty years
the time has been lessened from thirteen and fourteen hours to
ten hours per day, and the wages enhanced from fifty and
seventy-five cents per day to an average of two dollars per day.
In most of the prominent manufacturing establishments
throughout the North we are at a near approach to a reduction
of time to eight hours—<i>and may God speed the day</i>. Take the
advance in quantity of products for ten years only, and by the
aid of machinery, and more intelligent labor, we have gained
more than two hours. Why should not labor get its due proportion?
We are fast turning the drudgery of labor to pleasure.
You need but visit the dish-washing and laundry-rooms at the
Hotel Athenæum to witness the truth of what I state.</p>

<p>Some years ago I made an estimate of the number of inhabitants
it would require to do by hard labor that which was done
at that time by twelve thousand inhabitants by the use of steam
and water power. It reached the enormous number of three
hundred thousand inhabitants. From this we may learn that it
will not be a great hardship to give to labor more leisure and
more pay, not rashly as by strikes, but by prudent and gradual
measures.</p>

<p>Ah, the wealth of nations rests in this art! The power to
subdue forests and belt empires with railroads and telegraphs,
and ignore distance is in its hands.</p>

<p>This art sends forth its missionary in its manufactured products
to all quarters of the globe; every different product is a
copy of a volume on some subject, carrying with it some Christian’s
impress and prayer. So true is this that it needs no great
expert to tell an article made by Christian hands from that
made by heathen.</p>

<p>This power of the individuality impresses with interest and
wonder. How readily thoughts in words are detected from
others, even on the same subject. Every workman of a manufactured
article in some such sense makes his individual impress
on the work he performs, and it is as readily told. The
Christian, liberty-loving intelligence is pressed into every article
and sent forth on its mission of preaching the gospel to every
creature, even gaining entrance where the missionary is refused.
With this truth in mind, with what renewed pleasure must
the liberated laborer make still greater impress of his individual
mind. This thought can be carried into all that we do.
Our walk, our talk, and the expression of our faces all enter
into our products of whatever kind. How important that it
should be imbued with the spirit of intelligent Christianity.</p>

<p>Class of ’83, you have only opened the doors to wider range,
to fields of greater usefulness. All about you lie sleeping
elements to be quickened into activity. Have your accumulated
mental development well stored, and constantly add
more. The purpose of the study was more to create an appetite
for knowledge than to give a thorough or finished education.</p>

<p>We are glad as officers of the C. L. S. C. to present you with
diplomas having places for many seals. May there be no
laxity of effort until the crowning seal will emblazon over the
whole its rays.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Rev. Dr. Vincent said:</p>

<p>A large number of salutations from members of the C.
L. S. C. have been received, some of them breathing a simple
prayer of benediction on the Circle and its officers, others testifying
to the value of the Circle to them intellectually, socially,
and spiritually; many are too long to read at this time, but
every line has been carefully read by the Superintendent of
Instruction, and a few of the sentences are here reported:</p>

<p>From Sacramento, Cal.: “We long to be with you at the
Assembly; but since we can not be, be assured that as we read
of Commencement Day our hearts beat in sympathy with those
of the C. L. S. C.”</p>

<p>From Washington, D. C.: “Hearty thanks for so splendid
an opportunity of living more abundantly, as I have enjoyed
through the noble conception and sensible management of the
C. L. S. C. I hope to add many of its seals to my diploma.”</p>

<p>From St. Paul, Minn.: “The day in which ’83 passes through
the Golden Gate you, who are present amidst the jubilee, will
most likely forget the distant ones; but I for one will put on my
C. L. S. C. badge, take out two faded maple leaves, kept in remembrance
of last summer, and in imagination march with the
proud class under the Arches, while I will pray the good Lord to
bless Chautauqua.”</p>

<p>From Brooklyn, N. Y.: “The salutation, as recorded in Malachi
iii:16, ‘Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to
another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
remembrance was written before him for them that feared the
Lord and thought upon his name.’”</p>

<p>From San Francisco: A New Yorker writes: “I found <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> on a planter’s table in the Sandwich Islands, and
learned of a circle in Honolulu.”</p>

<p>A member writes: “The royal road to learning is no <i>terra
incognita</i>. Our <i>route en roi</i> is called <i>via</i> Chautauqua.”</p>

<p>From Amsterdam, N. Y.: A poem closes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I would like very much to Chautauqua to go;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It would certainly give me great joy;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But my duties are such that I linger at home:</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I’ve a year-old Chautauqua boy.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Elkhorn, Wis.: One who sees through the lenses of the
C. L. S. C., the Chautauqua University of the future, writes: “In
1904, A. D., I shall be fifty years old. At that time I hope to
graduate at the Chautauqua University. This will give me just
twenty-five years from the beginning of my course in 1876 to
complete the work, and I intend to work diligently every year.”</p>

<p>From Massachusetts: “Language would be left a beggar if
I were to tell you all that the C. L. S. C. has been to me. It
has been a song and a poem, when life was beginning to read
like prose. It has been sunshine on many a cloudy day. God
bless our alma mater, and make her days long in the land.”</p>

<p>From New York: “When the history of the successful men
and women of the next generation shall be written, may it be
found that the members of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle of 1883 are among the number.”</p>

<p>From Santa Barbara, Cal., comes the greeting of Mrs. M. P.
Austin, who prays that “the C. L. S. C. may do as much for
others as it has done for me.”</p>

<p>From St. Paul, Minn., a graduate writes: “Although in middle
life, I have rejoiced like a child at the prospect of graduating.
My studies have been precious to me; and, although I
have carried them on alone, the enthusiasm has never grown
less. May I boast of the dozen recruits whom I have brought
into the work, not for the name of it, but because I want everybody
to be benefited as I have been. Saturday will find me
in a white dress and blue ribbon, and I shall try to catch the
spirit which ascends to our Father, and have something of the
blessings which are invoked upon the graduates of that day.
May his blessed spirit be with you, and may he be precious not
only to them who believe, but to many who never before have
called on his name.”</p>

<p>From Massachusetts a member writes: “I have heard this
objection to the C. L. S. C., that it leads to neglect of Bible
study. My personal experience has been that I never spent
more time in Bible study or loved it more than during the past
four years.”</p>

<p>From Dakota a mother writes: “Although my boy is but
eleven years old, he has done the greater part of my reading
this year, and dear little Maggie, nine years of age, is greatly
interested in what she calls mamma’s course. She also often
reads for me, patiently spelling out the hard words.”</p>

<p>William C. Wilkinson, of Tarrytown, New York, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I send greeting, congratulation and God-speed to the class of
1883. A persistence on your part of four years in a course of
volunteer reading and study has not only created character in
you, but also proved that you possessed character to begin with.
It was not perfectly easy for you to do what you have done.
There have been times, more than once, during these four
years, when the temptation was strong to abandon your undertaking.
But you did not abandon it, simply because you would
not abandon it. Your will was strong enough to overcome the
strong temptation. Now your will is stronger for having been
strong. Go forward in this added strength to add strength
again. The will conquers by conquering, until it becomes at
length unconquerable. Conquer is a proud word. Let us
change it and say something meeker and truer. Let us say,
obey. We conquer only when we obey. You have obeyed
your conscience in accomplishing your appointed course. That
obedience is your victory. When the will is perfectly obedient
to conscience, conscience being at the same time perfectly enlightened
by the Word and by the Spirit of God, then we are
omnipotent. We reign then with Christ. All things are ours.
Go on, alumni of Chautauqua. Carry forward the banner. Let
it float in your hands ever farther and higher. I do not say
<i>plant</i> it anywhere. I say <i>bear</i> it onward and upward. There
is always, amid the Alps of our glorious endeavor and struggle,
a peak above and beyond. Climb that, and then—forward
still. The goal is never attained, but the race itself is better
than would be rest at the goal. Remember the ranks that are
behind you, year after year, in the future. Give them a generous
lead. Remember the one pioneer rank in advance of you.
Tread close on their heels. Follow, so that it will be hard for
your leaders to lead. Lead, so that it will be hard for your followers
to follow.</p>

<p>Bishop Henry W. Warren writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="right">“<span class="smcap">Top of the Rocky Mountains</span>, August 1, 1883.</div>

<p>“<i>Dear Chautauquans:</i>—Pausing to take a farewell look at the
Atlantic slope before going down that of the Pacific, my mind
passes over many a place of interest and rests on Chautauqua.
There is no more interesting place on the continent. How
many faces rise for recognition! But I can not indulge in personal
greetings, for the friends are so many and so dear that
time would fail me to speak of the institution that is the outcome
of the inspiration and labor of all these friends. William
Cullen Bryant said Chautauqua exemplified the spirit of mutual
encouragement. President Garfield said that it taught what to
do with the result of civilization’s first fight, leisure; and Bishop
Wiley said it was a Christian center, able to save the gospel if
there was nothing else left.</p>

<p>“Unquestionably, Chautauqua is the grandest inspiration and
quickening of mind in this century or any other. It is the consummate
flavoring of our Christian republican principles. It
offers all opportunities for growth to all men. It seems to present
as good a chance to every man as comes to any man.
This development of mind is our chief wealth. We turn auriferous
quartz into coin, iron ore into a body for the soul of
electricity, but mind had to be developed and refined first.
Rome sought wealth by the robbery of other nations, but she
never gained as much wealth in a decade as we develop from
nature in a year. What we need as a nation is a perpetual push
and effort of the masses of men to rise. They drag down none
of the few that are already eminent, but, by surpassing them,
incite to greater attainments. Let there be no fear that there
will be too many great men, or men too great. These vast glittering
snow-peaks about me find room enough, as well as the
mole hills. ‘There is always room at the top,’ for the top is
larger than the bottom, as these bending heavens are larger
than the earth, and eternity longer than time.</p>

<p>“Would that I could set one of these mountains near Chautauqua
and let its grassy base, its wooded slopes, its masses of ore,
its glittering crown of glorious light say to every beholder:
Here is an object lesson worthy of God’s giving to his child,
here is a symbol of the eternal power of the God-head of your
Father, here are hints of what his child may be. All things are
for all men; whosoever will, let him come and take.</p>

<p>“Dear members of the C. L. S. C. of 1883, I commend you to
the baccalaureate sermon of Dr. Vincent to-morrow for higher
and grander utterances than these heights can give; to Dr.
Abbott also for grander foundations than those of these mountains;
even those of the Christian faith, for the mountains shall
melt with fervent heat, but the word of God standeth forever.</p>

<p>After the reading of the congratulations and greetings,
Dr. Vincent and President Miller presented the members of
class ’83, present at Chautauqua, their well-earned diplomas.
Out of this wonderful class of graduates, numbering nearly
1,400, over 300 were present. The class has representatives
in all of the following States and Territories:</p>

<p>California, Maine, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Minnesota, Maryland,
Iowa, Illinois, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Kansas, Rhode Island,
Wisconsin, New Jersey, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia,
Connecticut, Missouri, District of Columbia, New Hampshire,
Colorado, Dakota, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Canada is also represented, and in far-away China there is
one graduate. Thirteen different denominations are represented,
as follows: Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational,
Episcopal, Baptist, Christian, United Presbyterian, Reformed,
Unitarian, Universalist, Friends, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day
Baptists.</p>

<p>The following occupations were represented: Teachers, housekeepers,
ministers, lawyers, clerks, students, mechanics, farmers,
merchants, dressmakers, milliners, music-teachers, and stenographers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>SOCIETY OF THE HALL IN THE GROVE.</h3>

<p>At 4 o’clock p. m., the Society of the Hall in the Grove assembled
in the Hall for counsel in regard to its future work. It
was clearly seen by all that the prosperity of the organization,
if not its very existence, required accommodations for its meetings,
such as Chautauqua could not now supply. After considerable
discussion of many suggestions, the following committee
was appointed to consider plans for the erection of a building,
or of a series of buildings, in the near future for the use of the
society: R. S. Holmes, of Auburn, N. Y.; A. M. Martin, of
Pittsburgh, Pa.; A. H. Gillet, Prof. Mattison, and S. J. M. Eaton,
D.D. A committee on constitution, aims and plans of the organization
was appointed, consisting of J. H. Vincent, D.D.; J.
R. Pepper, of Memphis, Tenn.; L. C. Peake, of Toronto, Canada;
R. S. Holmes and J. G. Allen. J. G. Allen and A. D.
Wilder were appointed additional members of the Guard of the
Banner.</p>

<p>After the Society of the Hall in the Grove had completed the
business, a social followed, and song and chat ruled the hour.</p>

<p>About 9 o’clock, under the direction of A. M. Martin, the
camp fires were lighted. In the midst of a light which was
nearly as bright as day, R. S. Holmes, I. I. Covet, of Pittsburgh;
J. H. Kellogg, of Troy, N. Y.; Lewis C. Peake, of Toronto;
Rev. J. H. Warren, of Tennessee, and A. M. Martin, of
Pittsburgh, made speeches, containing reminiscences of the
past, interspersed with song, and the great crowd appeared to
listen as attentively as if it had not heard a speech during the
day.</p>

<p>But the fires have burnt low, the people surround a bed of
hot coals, and the time for corn roasting has come. The boys
are ready, and some not boys in years are equally eager for the
“green corn dance.” Without coarseness or rudeness the fun
commenced, and continued till the night bells called to repose.
Thus closed the graduating exercises of the C. L. S. C. Class of
1883. From morning till night the tide of life ran high, shared
in by ten thousand people of all ages, from the tiny girl to the
veteran of many years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>ORDER OF THE WHITE SEAL.</h3>

<p>A meeting of the members of the Order of the White Seal
was held on Saturday evening at 7:30 o’clock in the Hall, Rev.
Dr. Eaton in the chair. In the absence of the secretary, the
minutes of last meeting were read by the chairman. On motion,
the Rev. S. J. M. Eaton, D. D., Franklin, Pa., was elected president
for the ensuing year, and Mr. L. C. Peake, Toronto, Can.,
secretary. Rev. W. H. Rogers reported on behalf of the Committee
on Individual Effort, Mrs. E. F. Curtiss for that on Local
Circles, and Miss Carrie C. Ferrin for that on the Round-Table.
On motion these reports were accepted. Committees for the ensuing
year were appointed as follows: On Individual Effort,
Rev. W. H. Rogers, Sodus, Wayne County, N. Y.; Miss Emily
Raymond, Toledo, O., and Miss C. Dickey, Geneseo, N. Y. On
Local Circles, Mrs. E. F. Curtiss, Geneseo, N. Y.; Miss Fannie
E. Roy, Atlanta, Ga., and Clarence H. Bean, Varysburg, N. Y.
On the Round-Table, Miss Carrie C. Ferrin, Ellington, N. Y.;
Mrs. A. W. Briggs, Elma, N. Y., and Miss M. C. McGowan,
Cincinnati, O.</p>

<h2><a name="MONTEREY_ASSEMBLY" id="MONTEREY_ASSEMBLY">MONTEREY ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>The Pacific Grove Assembly, held near Monterey, California,
devoted Friday, July 13, to the commencement exercises of the
C. L. S. C. We give a full report of the celebration:</p>

<p>Friday was a perfect Monterey day. The Chautauquans
gathered according to program in the large public parlor of the
railroad building and fell into line for a procession. The choir
sang a cheerful Chautauqua song, in which many others joined,
and then “processed.” First came the president and officers
of the society, then the graduates, then all members of the C.
L. S. C.—then everybody. All members wore an oak leaf, which
is the regulation badge, but members of the graduating class
wore for a decoration a broad badge of dark garnet-colored
ribbon, fringed with bullion, and with the unfailing “C. L. S.
C.” and the figures “1883” printed upon it in gold. They
marched toward the Assembly Hall, passing under the motto-inscribed
and garlanded arches, and entering the building proceeded
to the front seats, which had been reserved. The hall,
under the care of the decorative committee, had broken out
into fresh verdure and bloom, while the letters “C. L. S. C.”
and the class dates, “1879-1883,” had blossomed out in gold
and scarlet upon the white wall behind the speakers’ platform.</p>

<p>The hall was full to overflowing. Everybody on the grounds
had been invited to be present, and the greatest interest was
manifested by all. The exercises began with an inspiring
Chautauqua song. An earnest and appropriate prayer was offered
by Rev. Dr. Heacock, of San Jose, and then a beautiful
letter of greeting from Dr. Vincent, the founder of the society,
was read. It was full of cordial friendliness, outlined briefly
the benefits which he trusted all had received from pursuing the
C. L. S. C. studies, and pointed out the catholicity and wide
helpfulness of the Chautauqua Idea. It closed with words of
stimulus and encouragement, as well as congratulation. Prof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Norton now made a brief but admirable introductory address.
He spoke of the Chautauqua enthusiasm and interest as an intellectual
revival. It is a work for the masses, differing from
that of the great universities of whose benefits only a few favored
ones can avail themselves. It goes to homes of poverty,
to workshops and kitchens as well as the libraries and parlors.
It is food for the hungry wherever they may be. It comes to
lives which have been arid and desolate through monotonous
toil. He spoke of the great increase of insanity among our farming
population, owing, no doubt, to the lack of healthful mental
occupation. The C. L. S. C. course of reading and plans for
neighborhood circles may help these lonely, overworked people
to new and broader horizons of thought and life. Prof. Norton
closed with a pathetic and poetic comparison between our real
lives and our temporary sojourn by the great sea which tosses
and surges before us. Our footsteps on the shore here are
washed away by every incoming tide, so with our “footsteps on
the sands of time.” The great sea of eternity will soon efface
all our little earthly deeds. Let us live for eternal things. Let
to-day be a commencement indeed—a beginning of grander
and better living, of deeds which shall survive in the long years
of God.</p>

<p>The quartet choir sang another beautiful song, and then three
essays were read from the graduates.</p>

<p>A delicate little prose-poem called “Childhood in Literature,”
by Miss Myrtie Hudson, of San Jose (a post-graduate of our society),
was read by Miss Lydia Bean. The diplomas were
presented by Dr. Stratton, who remarked when giving them
that these diplomas do not confer degrees, but something better
than a degree, for they represent mature study, habits of
fixed thought and life-long intellectual growth.</p>

<p>There were more than forty C. L. S. C. graduates in our State
this year. The following were present: Mrs. Lydia A. French,

<p>After the commencement exercises the crowd dispersed, and
the friends of the graduates gathered around them to congratulate
and exchange friendly greetings. But it was late lunch-time,
and the keen demands of appetite were never keener
than here at Pacific Grove. So, with the understanding that
all were to reassemble at 2 o’clock p. m., those who had lingered
hastened away. The hour for meeting soon arrived, and
the Chautauquans mustered in force at the beautiful cove near
Prospect Park. After a lively social time, President Stratton
called the meeting to order and pointed out a suggestive-looking
traveling photographer, armed with the usual camera and
other implements, who had been hovering about a neighboring
cliff, and evidently had intentions of immortalizing the C. L. S.
C. Assembly. Everybody was requested to assume a graceful
attitude and a pleased expression, which they made haste to do.
The beach was covered with people, standing, sitting, reclining.
It was very hard work to be sober and proper, and look as dignified
as future ages will demand. Our president reclined upon
the sand, as befitted “the noblest Roman of us all;” the secretary
sat upright and faced the music; the modest vice-president
tried to get away, but was restrained by his numerous admiring
friends; the small boys in front were entreated to keep still;
the photographer removed the pall-like black cloth, and the
deed was done. The result was quite successful, and the picture
may yet hang in the “Hall in the Grove,” that eastern
Chautauquans may see how their transcontinental comrades
look when disporting themselves by the sunset sea.</p>

<p>The photograph business being disposed of, the next thing in
order was the Round-Table. There was no table to speak of,
but a great deal of “round”—an informal all ’round talk in a
pleasant, familiar fashion. Everybody was seated upon the
shining white sand, a soft gray sky overhead, a mild, warm atmosphere
enfolding all, and the illimitable sea stretching out
before us and breaking in soft murmurs at our feet. Members
from all over the State gave, in brief conversational style,
cheering reports of their various circles, and the utmost interest
was manifested by all in the common weal. The tone of the
meeting was decidedly inspiring, and all seemed ready to
promise improvement and renewed effort.</p>

<p>The next evening was the mussel-bake. A blazing fire had
been built upon the sand, but far from the assemblage, and
much vigorous <i>muscle</i> was displayed in stirring the embers
and piling on driftwood and resinous pine cones, but as to the
<i>mussels</i>, perhaps the less said about them the better. There
were, indeed, mussels baked, and they were passed around
upon a board in the most approved style, but it must be confessed
the supply was not very abundant. The whole mussel-bake
was a little like Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet left out.
The explanation lay in the fact that mussels can only be gathered
in certain places and at very low tide, and there had been
a little misunderstanding. Nevertheless, brethren, we had a
grand time, an unlimited supply of apples and freshly-roasted
peanuts, and we fully propose to have a mussel-bake every
year!</p>

<p>At a business meeting held during the assembly, Rev. Dr.
Stratton was re-elected to the presidency of the Pacific Coast
C. L. S. C.; Dr. C. L. Anderson, of Santa Cruz, was elected vice-president;
Mrs. M. H. Field, of San Jose, general secretary and
treasurer; Miss Mary Bowman, of San Jose, secretary of the
Assembly, and Mrs. Eloise Dawson, of San Jose, treasurer of
the Assembly. Votes of thanks were given to many benefactors
and to retiring officers, especially to Miss M. E. B. Norton, who
has given our Branch the most faithful and untiring service.</p>

<p>Our newly elected executive committee consists of Rev. C. C.
Stratton, D.D., San Jose, president; C. L. Anderson, M.D.,
vice-president, Santa Cruz; Mrs. M. H. Field, general secretary,
San Jose; Mrs. Eloise Dawson, San Jose, treasurer; Rev. J.

<h2><a name="MONTEAGLE_ASSEMBLY" id="MONTEAGLE_ASSEMBLY">MONTEAGLE ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> J. H. WARREN.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Monteagle Assembly is located at Monteagle, Grundy County,
Tenn., on the top of Cumberland Mountain, fifteen miles from
Cowan, between Sewanee and Tracy City, immediately on the
railroad owned and managed by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and
Railroad Company. Cowan is a small village on the Nashville
and Chattanooga Railroad, eighty-four miles from Nashville and
sixty-four miles from Chattanooga. The ride up the mountain
from Cowan to the Assembly grounds is one of the most picturesque
in this country. The ascent for the first nine miles is
1,100 feet. The Assembly owns a hundred acres of land, which
have been laid out into parks, drives, avenues, and building lots.
About twenty-five acres have already been improved, and quite
a number of lots have been sold to individuals upon which to
build cottages. An amphitheater, capable of seating 2,000 persons,
on the plan of the one at Chautauqua, has been erected.
Within a very short distance of the Assembly grounds is some
of the most magnificent mountain scenery to be found in any
country. The elevation is 2,140 feet above the sea level. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Assembly is strictly undenominational. Each Christian denomination
is entitled to four members in the board of trustees,
provided they have as many members of the Assembly. The
charter prohibits it from being managed for the pecuniary interest
of any person or persons.</p>

<p>The first annual meeting of the Assembly has closed. It was
a success beyond our most sanguine expectation. The Normal
School and Teachers’ Retreat opened July 2, and closed August
4. These schools were all well attended. More than one hundred
and fifty teachers attended the Normal alone. About
fifty-two studied elocution. These teachers were from several
States, and a more intelligent class I have never seen collected
together anywhere.</p>

<p>The Assembly opened July 17, and closed August 6. At the
opening service there were 1,000 people present. The attendance
was good during the entire Assembly. At one time on
the grounds there were twenty-one States and nineteen Christian
denominations represented.</p>

<p>In the program, two days were given to temperance, one day
to Y. M. C. A. work, two days to missions, foreign and domestic,
and two days to education. The meetings throughout were of
great interest.</p>

<p>Out of the large number of speakers on the program only
four or five failed to attend.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school normal instruction, the children’s meetings,
and Mr. Van Lennep’s “Oriental and Biblical Museum”
were interesting features of the Assembly.</p>

<p>But I desire to call special attention to the work of the C. L.
S. C. at Monteagle. We recognize this as an institution in this
country. It is fast finding its way into many of our Southern
homes, and bringing sunshine and blessings to many hearts.</p>

<p>At our solicitation, Dr. J. H. Vincent was present two or three
days of the Assembly, and represented the C. L. S. C. His
words of wisdom and cheer were a joy to many hearts. There
were twenty members of the C. L. S. C. present to greet him.
This number was increased to seventy before the Assembly
adjourned.</p>

<p>A permanent organization was perfected, with Miss Emma
Brown, Memphis, Tenn., president, and Miss Anna W. Thomas,
Memphis, Tenn., secretary. The idea is to have annual meetings
at Monteagle.</p>

<p>Each member went away determined to organize local circles
at their homes, so that when we return next year, if permitted
to do so, the members will have swelled from fifty to five
hundred. We hope Dr. Vincent will favor us with his presence
each year.</p>

<p>During the Assembly a number of C. L. S. C. Round-Tables
were held, which were profitable, socially and intellectually.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 21 was held the first C. L. S. C. camp-fire
at Monteagle, under the leadership of Dr. Vincent. The
speeches and songs were full of inspiration and good cheer.
We only regret that hundreds of our people in the South were
not present to enjoy the meetings with us, and take fresh courage
and inspiration for the work of life.</p>

<p>Miss Thomas, our secretary, has been instructed to correspond
with all members of the C. L. S. C., who were at Monteagle, and
all others whose names and post-office addresses she can get.
She would be glad to have the names of all who are interested
in this work. We desire to arrange for some organized effort
to push this work out into the many homes of our country. Let
every city, town, and village, and neighborhood, organize a
circle.</p>

<p>Those members of the C. L. S. C., who were at Monteagle,
have determined to erect a Hall of Philosophy, that we may
have a place in which to hold our meetings each year. This
can be done very easily by a little co-operative effort.</p>

<p>All things considered, the Assembly was quite a success. The
outlook is encouraging. Although located in the South, it is not
a Southern institution, it is for the public good. Let the people
come from the North, South, East, and West; all will be equally
welcome. Life is too short to harbor animosities. Let us enter
the struggles and conflicts of life like heroes and heroines. As
a nation, we have a grand work before us to elevate our people
socially, morally, religiously, and intellectually. Monteagle
proposes to do her part. Will the good people of this country
stand by us in this noble work? If you will, success is sure.
There is no other enterprise of the kind in the South. The
people are united. Give us your prayers and co-operation. If
you desire to do good with your money, take hold of Monteagle
Assembly.</p>

<p>To the sister assemblies over the land, we send words of
greeting. To all the members of the C. L. S. C. throughout this
broad land we extend the right hand of fellowship. For the
unity, peace, and the uplifting of our people, and the establishing
of Christ’s kingdom, may we all be united, heart and hand,
in Christian love and sympathy.</p>

<h2><a name="MONONA_LAKE_ASSEMBLY" id="MONONA_LAKE_ASSEMBLY">MONONA LAKE ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>No one can estimate the extent to which the C. L. S. C. is
growing. One State after another surrenders to its influence.
During the past year Wisconsin has taken hold of the work,
and is now showing a wonderful interest in the studies of the
“home college.” The little text-books have found their way
into many a quiet family, and are beginning to revolutionize
society in every city, village, and country neighborhood.</p>

<p>This fact was shown very clearly at the Assembly held at
Monona Lake, near Madison, Wisconsin. Many local circles
sent representatives to this gathering to receive, through them,
inspiration and strength for the work of the coming year. The
total attendance from various localities was nearly two hundred.
C. L. S. C. Day was the best of the whole session. Although
an entirely new feature, yet the people became so enthused
that about a thousand called for circulars of information, and
many joined the Circle before they left the grounds.</p>

<p>Rev. A. H. Gillet, the president of the Monona Lake Branch,
delivered the annual address, in which he explained most admirably
the object and aim of the Circle. Twelve persons, who
had completed the four years’ course, were present to receive
their diplomas, and notwithstanding the absence of the “Golden
Gate” and the “Hall of Philosophy,” everything had the
Chautauqua appearance, and the very atmosphere was filled
with classic odors.</p>

<p>The camp-fire in the evening was a feature that will never be
forgotten by those present. After the feast of solid food during
the day, this evening hour was filled with real enjoyment, and
many humorous speeches that were made as the flames ascended
and the sparks disappeared in the starry dome above,
served to lighten every heart, and to close the day with the
feeling that it was indeed the best of the season.</p>

<p>The round-table conferences, conducted by Rev. A. H. Gillet,
were full of interest. Some very important questions were discussed,
and the members present prepared for successful work
in their respective homes. The Chautauqua Songs were sung
at all of these meetings, and never did “Day is Dying in the
West” sound more sweetly than at Monona Lake.</p>

<p>But of all the exercises connected with the Circle, the Sunday
evening vesper services were the best. Here was shown the
real secret of Chautauqua success. Nearly every member, engaged
during the week in gathering knowledge of art, science
and literature, was found in his place on Sunday evening, lifting
his heart to God, and showing thereby that we “keep our
Heavenly Father in our midst.”</p>

<p>The organization of Monona Lake Branch was perfected by
the election of Rev. A. H. Gillet as president, and Mrs. William
Millard, of Milwaukee, secretary. An executive committee was
appointed to arrange the plans for next year. We look forward
to good reports from this daughter of Chautauqua, and give her
a hearty welcome.</p>

<h2><a name="ISLAND_PARK_ASSEMBLY" id="ISLAND_PARK_ASSEMBLY">ISLAND PARK ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>Unusual interest was manifest this season at Island Park,
near Rome City, Indiana. The Assembly, conducted by Rev.
A. H. Gillet, of Cincinnati, Ohio, was a great success. The
place is growing in favor each year, and the fire kindled there
will not only continue to burn, but to spread, until every hamlet
within a radius of many miles shall receive the light and warming
influences that come from such gatherings. The attendance
this year was larger than ever before, the people were of a better
class, and the program, as carried out, gave universal satisfaction.
The singing of the Wilberforce Concert Company
delighted everybody. Among the lecturers were Drs. O. H.
Tiffany and C. H. Fowler, of New York City; Dr. Justin D.
Fulton, of Brooklyn, N. Y.; Drs. Stocking and Alabaster, of
Detroit, Michigan, and Dr. P. S. Henson, of Chicago, Illinois.
Dr. W. C. Richards, of Chicago, gave several very interesting
lectures on “Electricity.” The Island Park Branch of the C. L.
S. C. was regularly organized this year, with Rev. A. H. Gillet
as president, and J. L. Shearer, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, secretary.
There were over two hundred members in attendance.
The daily round-table conferences, conducted by Rev. Gillet
and Dr. J. L. Hurlbut, of Plainfield, N. J., were highly appreciated
by the members present, and many valuable suggestions
given and received by these mutual discussions. The circle is
enlarging continually in Indiana and Michigan, so that there is
scarcely a town or village in which there is not a local circle,
or at least a few individual members. Many have joined the
class of ’87, and quite a large number, having completed the
four years’ course, were present to receive their diplomas.
C. L. S. C. day was the best of the session. Dr. C. H. Fowler,
of New York City, delivered the annual address. The camp-fire
was the grandest ever seen at Island Park.</p>

<p>Plans for the erection of a C. L. S. C. building are under consideration,
a reading-room for the benefit of the Circle, an Island
Park lecture association, and many other novel features are
things of the near future.</p>

<p>The Music College, under the direction of Prof. C. C. Case,
of Akron, Ohio, the school of languages, the department of
elocution, the art school, and the secular teachers’ normal were
also well attended. It is the intention of the managers to
lengthen the time of these departments next year, and to offer
additional facilities to those who wish to improve their vacation
by carrying on some line of study. On the whole, we can say
that Island Park Assembly is a fixed fact, a thing that has come
to stay, and we are glad that the people are beginning to appreciate
and to value the educating and refining influences of
these gatherings.</p>

<h2><a name="LAKESIDE_ASSEMBLY" id="LAKESIDE_ASSEMBLY">LAKESIDE ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>A regular “C. L. S. C. Day” was provided for in the program at
the Lakeside, Ohio, Sunday-school encampment, and the “recognition
of the Class of ’83” arranged for. The absence of Rev. J.
H. Vincent, D.D., was an unexpected and greatly lamented interruption
to our plans. But the inspiration of the “Chautauqua
Idea,” which Lakeside has caught and thoroughly incorporated
into its own fiber, did not allow a dampening of ardor, and so
the “day” went on as days will, and especially such sunny
days by Lake Erie as that was. Happily Lewis Miller, Esq., President
of the C. L. S. C., was persuaded to remain a while and
lend his cheery face, his wise words and his authoritative presence
to the occasion.</p>

<p>A large audience, filling the capacious Auditorium, assembled,
the members of the Class of ’83 took seats on the platform,
and President Miller occupied the chair. After opening
exercises in the use of the responsive services provided, copies
of which were distributed among the audience, addresses were
delivered by Rev. Dr. Hartupee, Rev. Dr. Worden, Prof. Frank
Beard, and Rev. B. T. Vincent. After these had concluded,
President Miller called the members of the class to their feet,
and in a neat and appropriate address “recognized” them
thereby as graduates of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle, as part of the great class of fourteen hundred for the
current year. A round-table was also held, conducted by Rev.
B. T. Vincent, at which the subject of C. L. S. C. work was
taken up by those present, and treated in a most practical
manner. Representatives from several local circles gave outlines
of their plans of work, and questions from interested students
as to methods, etc., brought forth suggestive answers,
awakening new interest in the subject of study, and stirring the
uninitiated, of whom many were present, into an interest in the
work. A Sunday evening C. L. S. C. vesper service was also
most interesting. On the last evening of the encampment,
Bishop Hurst, who was present, applied the subject of general
reading as represented in the C. L. S. C. in its relation to a
firmer religious texture in Christian character, in a ringing address
which did much toward awakening new interest in this
great work. The enthusiasm excited by the meetings in this
behalf was cordially felt by Lakeside people, and it is determined
to make the “recognition” of the class of the current
year, and also the round-table, features of the annual program
hereafter.</p>

<p>Surrounded as Lakeside is by an immense area filled with
studious and enterprising people who are taking hold of the C.
L. S. C. readings, and who are finding their special center
of summer gathering there, this provision will be a source of
great gratification to them, and a means of extending these benefits
to many who only thus are brought into contact with this
agency of Christian intelligence and popular culture.</p>

<h2><a name="MOUNTAIN_LAKE_PARK_ASSEMBLY" id="MOUNTAIN_LAKE_PARK_ASSEMBLY">MOUNTAIN LAKE PARK ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>The fifth annual session of this Assembly lasted ten days,
August 7-17. Some will recall the fact that the institution was
established in the Cumberland Valley, Pennsylvania, and was
held there for three successive years. Last year the experiment
was made of holding the meeting in the Glades, at the new resort
called Mountain Lake Park, Maryland. The new field
was so full of promise and hope that it was at once determined
to make it the center of the movement henceforth. The place
is unique in some of its features, situated in the midst of a series
of table-land glades, between the peaks of the Alleghenies,
in the vicinity of some most romantic and stirring scenery,
and possessing an atmosphere abounding in stimulation and
vigor. Two years ago the region was an uninhabited wilderness,
with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad resort, Deer Park, on
one side three miles away, and Oakland, the county seat of
Garrett County, two miles to the west. Now it is a summer settlement
abounding in picturesque cottages, beautiful drives, and
linked to a Sunday-school Assembly and to “summer schools”
of various sorts for all time to come.</p>

<p>The lecture course of the session just past was of a high order.
It included three superb addresses from Dr. Lyman Abbott,
full of vigorous thought, religious ardor, and primed and
charged with suggestiveness—“Why I believe in God, in Christ,
and in the Bible.” Prof. Cumnock gave two magnificent entertainments
in the shape of readings and recitations. Prof.
Young, of Princeton, delighted us with three illustrated astronomical
lectures; and the Rev. Jesse Bowman Young gave
three tours, illustrated also with the stereopticon: “The Marvels
of Colorado,” “London and Paris,” and “From Dan to
Beersheba.” Prof. Harris, on the “Wrong side of the Moon,”
Dr. Huntley, on the “Amen Corner,” Bishop Andrews, on “The
Method of the New Testament Law,” and Dr. Payne, with two
lectures, all did their best work, and earned and received high
appreciation.</p>

<p>The normal classes were under the instruction of Rev. J. B.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Young, Rev. J. T. Judd, Rev. J. Vance, and Prof. Elliott of Baltimore.
The lessons were chosen in part from Dr. Vincent’s
“Normal Outlines,” and in part were prepared by Mr. Judd.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Young conducted two enthusiastic and interesting
services during the closing days of the Assembly, developing
the “Chautauqua Idea.” Drs. Frysinger, Van Meter, and Leech,
Messrs. Judd, Vance, Baldwin, Lindsey, and others, made capital
addresses, bringing out as phases of this “Idea” the following
elements: home study, Bible study, normal work, study of
the classics, of literature, of the sciences.</p>

<p>On the last night of the Assembly at Mountain Lake Park the C.
L. S. C. was organized, with over fifty members, Rev. J. T. Judd,
of Harrisburg, Pa., being elected president, and Miss Jennie M.
Jones, of the same city, secretary.</p>

<p>Thus from the tip-top of the Alleghenies we send out greetings
to other Chautauquans, and join in the glorious work which
is in marvelous measure leavening the land.</p>

<h2><a name="NEW_ENGLAND_ASSEMBLY" id="NEW_ENGLAND_ASSEMBLY">NEW ENGLAND ASSEMBLY.</a></h2>


<p>The “Chautauqua Idea” is taking deep root in the soil of
New England. Four years ago the first Assembly was held on
the grounds of the Framingham Campmeeting Association.
There was a fair attendance, and considerable enthusiasm.
Each year has been an improvement. The number in attendance
has been greater, and the interest has been on the increase.
This year has been the best of all. Almost from the first the
lodging accommodations were taxed to their utmost in providing
for the unexpectedly large numbers. The gentleman in charge
of the dormitory stated to the writer that he had a greater rush
the first day of the Assembly, this year, than he had the first
week of last year. Thus it continued during the ten days. It
is therefore safe to conclude, that in a financial way, the meeting
was a success beyond its predecessors.</p>

<p>The work of the various departments was done efficiently by
Dr. Vincent, in charge, assisted by Dr. Hurlbut, and Prof.
Holmes, at the head of the normal classes; Prof. Sherwin at
the front with a magnificent chorus of nearly two hundred voices;
Frank Beard with a drawing class of one hundred and fifty; and
the platform occupied by such men as Prof. Richards, Dr. Lyman
Abbott, Dr. Angell, Wallace Bruce, Dr. Hull, Dr. J. B. Thomas,
Dr. Tiffany, Prof. Young, A. O. Van Lennep, and others. A feast
of good things was to be expected, and we were not disappointed.</p>

<p>One of the enjoyable features of the Assembly was Rev. O.
S. Baketel’s lecture on “Sights and Insights at Chautauqua,”
illustrated with eighty stereopticon views. They were shown
with the calcium light, and an audience of four thousand people
sat for an hour and three quarters, hearing and seeing. It
created a great deal of interest, both with old Chautauquans and
the many who have never seen Chautauqua.</p>

<p>Prof. Sherwin had several very excellent soloists, and his
chorus was exceptionally fine.</p>

<p>One of the new buildings this year is the C. L. S. C. office.
This is a very neat structure, and greatly appreciated by those
having in charge the C. L. S. C. It was usually crowded during
office hours. About five hundred members of the Circle
were present during the Assembly. One hundred and sixty-five
joined the Class of 1887. Thirty-eight members of the
graduating class were present and received their diplomas from
the hands of Dr. Vincent. The Class of 1884 are thoroughly
organized, and are looking forward to a grand time when next
year’s bells shall ring in their festal day.</p>

<p>As usual, Mrs. Rosie M. Baketel had charge of the C. L. S. C.
office. This is her third year in this position. She is one of the
hardest workers on the grounds.</p>

<p>The presence of Dr. Vincent is always an inspiration to a
Framingham audience. Though compelled to return to Chautauqua
after the opening, he gave us a grand “send-off,” and
his presence and labors when he returned again were greatly
enjoyed.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_WE_CAME_TOGETHER" id="HOW_WE_CAME_TOGETHER">HOW WE CAME TOGETHER.</a></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[The following poem, from Counselor W. C. Wilkinson’s volume, recently published
by Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons, tells the story of the author’s first meeting with
a friend of his, who is also a friend of every reader of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>—the Rev.
John H. Vincent, D.D. The friendship thus formed, not less than twenty years ago,

<h2><a name="VEGETABLE_VILLAINS" id="VEGETABLE_VILLAINS">VEGETABLE VILLAINS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE PLANT COMMUNITY AND ITS VILLAINS.</h3>

<p>No paradise could be complete for us without a pervading
freshness of green in wood and field. In lazy moods and calm
sunshiny weather there are few men who will not condescend
to stretch out their limbs under a spreading beech, or at least
to envy one who is taking life easily for a time in the shade.
We all know what a pleasant faint rustle of leaves there is
above, and what a flickering of mellowed sunlight comes over
the eyes, and how these steal into the heart with a sense of soft
content, till we are apt to become like little children, enjoying
without much thought, yielding ourselves up to the delight of
the mere living, letting our consciousness float along lazily on
the current of being. But if we can in such circumstances
nerve ourselves to reflect just a little, we shall—if we possess
even a very slight knowledge of the processes of nature—become
conscious that there are great silent energies and activities at
work around us in every blade of grass, and above us in the
cool green foliage. The leaves have myriads of invisible little
mouths eagerly drinking in the unseen air, and the minute
grains that give the green color to these leaves are all the while
laying hold of the infinitesimal percentage of carbonic acid impurity
in that air, and, invigorated by the quickening sunlight,
are able to tear this gaseous impurity to pieces, to wrench the
two elements that form it asunder, making the one into nutriment
for themselves, and letting the other go free in its purity
into the wide atmosphere. What man—with all his sound and
fury, his hammering and clanking—has never achieved, is thus
quietly done in summer days by every green leaf in God’s
world, and inorganic matter is forced to live. While the sun
shines these honest workers are striving with all their might to
lay hold of every atom of this gas that fouls the atmosphere for
animals, and thus, while finding food for themselves, they are
keeping the air sweet and pure for other living things. The
necessity is laid on them to maintain themselves by honest
work; and it is interesting to reflect how massive are the material
results that gather round their task. We are apt to forget
that by far the greater part of the solid matter of vegetation—of
the giant trees of California as well as of the tiniest grasses
and green herbs—is thus gathered atom by atom from the atmosphere.
One eats his potato thankfully, usually without
bothering himself much as to how it came to be a potato; how
the green leaves labored away, seizing the scanty atoms of an
invisible gas and making them into starch; how this insoluble
starch became a soluble thing, and melting away into the sap
flowed through the stem to the tubers, there to form again into
little grains and be laid up for future use. The rest of the
nourishment of such honest plants is usually derived from the
soil. The more stimulating food—within certain limits—that
crops, for instance, take up by the roots, the harder do their
green parts work in the sunlight, making starch and kindred
substances out of what they can snatch from the atmosphere.
Hence the value of manures; they are stimulants to increased
endeavor. Such honest, hard-working plants form by far the
greater bulk of vegetation, and of those that grow on land
nearly all are conspicuously green. Sometimes—but rarely—the
green is disguised a little by another color associated with
it, or some tint that is but skin-deep. Take a leaf of the copper
beech, for instance, scratch the surface, and you will find the
honest green beneath. Even the despised field-weeds, that
come up wherever man digs or plows, and linger lovingly
about his agriculture, so be it that they are green, are honest in
their way, and only take hold of what earth they can find to
root in, that they may participate with their fellows in the blessings
to be got and given by keeping the atmosphere pure. Man
wants to grow grain, or something of the kind, where they prefer
to grow, and so, as they foul his husbandry, he ruthlessly roots
them out, or tries at least. It is their misfortune that man does not
wish them there; but still, contemned creatures as they are, they
have honest ways about them, and every green grain in their being
is struggling hard to do something genuinely useful. It is only
an earnest striving to hold their own against man and brute, that
makes humble nettles clothe themselves with stings full of formic
acid and fury, and rude thistles bristle with a sharp <i>nemo me impune
lacessit</i> at every prickle point. They are armed for defense,
not aggression. It is not of stuff such as this that vegetable
villains are made.</p>

<p>Since there is so much honesty, however, in the plant
world, rogues, and thieves, and pilferers must abound. Consider
the animal kingdom. Where herds of deer roam in the
wilds there beasts of prey are on the prowl, or sportsmen stalk
with murderous guns in hand. Where herrings and pilchards
crowd in shoals clouds of gulls and gannets hover, and porpoises
with rapacious maws tumble and roll about. Where
earthworms abound there moles with ravenous appetite are furiously
driving mines, or birds that have sharp, quick bills keep
watch with keen eyes. And so in this honest plant community,
preying on it and pilfering from it, live and flourish hosts of
vegetable villains; some without a trace of green in their whole
being, living by theftuous practices alone; some with just the
faintest suspicion of green and the slightest indications of a
true nature; others with a good deal of the better color about
them, but still only indifferently honest. There is something of
marvel and mystery about these plant pilferers—of strange peculiarities
in their modes of life, and in their adaptations for
plundering and preying, which can hardly fail to interest intelligent
minds, even when brought before them in a sketch such
as this, which does not profess to take in more than the outermost
fringe of a wide field. Without terms and technicalities
and a strange jargon of crabbed words that would be dry as
dust, and meaningless to most readers, little professing to be
thorough can be done; yet, after all, something more generally
comprehensive may ooze through in comparatively plain English.</p>

<p>With regard to their pilfering habits, such plants are usually
proportioned off into two great groups. They either attach
themselves to other beings and absorb their juices, in which
case they form a mighty host of plants of prey usually known
as <i>parasites;</i> or they seek their nurtriment, and find it, in dead
and decaying organisms, and are then known as <i>saprophytes</i>,
a somewhat hard word to begin with, for which I can not find
a popular equivalent, but which merely signifies plants that
grow on decomposing matter. All land plants that are not
blessed with a true green color belong to one or other of these
groups, and are villains in their various degrees. They make
no effort to free the air from the gaseous impurity that haunts
it, but, like animals, they keep fouling it instead. With a very
few exceptions, all of them subsist on organic matter in some
form, and this they usually draw from the plants, living or
dead, on which they grow, or from decaying matter in the soil.
But many of these vegetable villains run into half-honest vagaries,
and succeed in raising themselves slightly above the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ruck. If they can not seize and break up carbonic acid
gas, they may do a little toward atmospheric purification of a
kind by laying fast hold on such organic particles as are floating
in the air or brought to them in falling moisture. Plants
such as these are sometimes found growing on barren sand, on
hard gravel, on parapets of bridges, on leaden cisterns, on plastered
walls, on slag, and in like inhospitable places, where they
are compelled to turn mainly to the atmosphere and trickling
moisture for food. Some such haunt mines like phosphorescent
ghosts, others make themselves at home on places like the
dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. In a mass two feet in length,
similar strange plants were one morning long ago found by a
smith on a piece of iron that he had taken, on the previous
night, red-hot from his fire, and laid on his water trough. Many
similar vagaries they run into that would in the telling sound
almost incredible. Indeed, the whole group of the saprophytes
is not to be accounted so utterly abandoned as that of the parasites.
To these they are certainly nearly related, but there is
more of the useful scavenger about them than of the useless
thief. No sooner has death overtaken any plant than a host
of them set to work to clear away the now useless organism
from the world, breaking down herbaceousness into putrescence,
timber into touchwood, and all at last into vegetable mould.
Their mission is to seize upon decaying matter and endow it
with life in a new form; and thus out of rottenness often comes
wholesomeness, decay moulding itself into pleasant mushrooms,
or into things unfit for human food perhaps, but that may bring
the blessings of abundance to many little living creatures. If
such as are edible are to be considered villains, then people of
delicate palate who smack their lips over some of them have a
right to insist that these should be specially classed as dainty
little rogues.</p>

<p>Still this useful scavengering habit is nearly allied to the pilfering
one. Decay attacks part of a tree, for instance, and saprophytes
set to work at the dead branch, but they are apt to extend
their operations to the adjoining living tissues, which die,
too, and decay, till in the end the tree may be entirely destroyed.
The scavenger, we can thus understand, is apt on occasion
to relapse into the thief and the out-and-out villain.</p>

<p>To one or other of these two great groups, or occasionally to
both, belong, besides a few flowering plants, the whole extensive
division of the fungi, and it is to be noted that none of this
curious class of plants is ever blessed with leaf-green or starch
in any part of its substance. Whether minute even under
powerful microscopes or measuring several feet across; whether
hard as wood or a mere mass of jelly; whether horny, fleshy,
or leathery; whether resisting the action of the elements for
years or hardly able to outlive a puff of wind; whether beautiful,
commonplace, or ugly; whether sweet-scented or otherwise,
in this they agree, that in all of them is wanting that
greenness which makes honest work possible, and those little
grains of starch that come from honest work done.—<i>Good
Words.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> afraid that a lightsome disposition and a relish for humor
are not so common in those whose benevolence takes an
active turn as in people of sentiment, who are always ready
with their tears and abounding in passionate expressions of
sympathy. Working philanthropy is a practical specialty, requiring
not a mere impulse, but a talent, with a peculiar sagacity
for finding its objects, a tact for selecting its agencies, an organizing
and arranging faculty, a steady set of nerves, and a
constitution such as Sallust describes in Catiline, patient of
cold, of hunger, and of watching. Philanthropists are commonly
grave, occasionally grim, and not very rarely morose.
Their expansive social force is imprisoned as a working power,
to show itself only through its legitimate pistons and cranks.

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The mythology of various tribes and races has of late attracted
much attention, while that of our own ancestors of the North
has been studied with the greatest care.</p>

<p>Little attention, however, has been devoted to the religious
belief of the ancient Slavonic race, and yet it is replete with
interest for all who yield to the fascination of ancient myth.</p>

<p>We unfortunately possess no Slavic Edda, or Veda, to throw
illumination upon the ancient creed of the tribes, but a few
scattered facts have come down to modern times—principally
contained in popular songs—but sufficient to enable us to observe
the similarity between Slavonic mythology and that of the
other members of the Indo-European stock—all pointing to that
immensely ancient time when the ancestors of the combined
race could have been gathered within the circuit of the same
camp; when they passed the same lives and worshiped the
same divinities; wept when the “serpents of the night” strangled
the god appointed to preside over the day, and rejoiced
together with an exceeding great joy when the day-god, victorious
over his foes, gilded the hills again.</p>

<p>In Slavonic tradition Swarog is represented as the most ancient
of their gods, as the one who was originally—before
Perkunas—the supreme deity of those tribes, corresponding to
Sanskrit Surya, like Helios in Greece, the dweller in the orb of
the sun. Swarog was the pervading, irresistible luminary, the
solar deity, <i>par excellence</i>, of the race, and vague recollections
of him still exist. In some places Swarog seems to have yielded
to another solar deity, Dazhbog, the god of fruitfulness, represented
as the son of Swarog.</p>

<p>The etymological signification of Dazhbog is the “day-god.”
With him, as a representative of the sun, was a god named
Khors—probably, however, but another name of the day-god.</p>

<p>Ogon, answering closely to Sanskrit Agni, Latin, <i>ignis</i> (fire),
was the god of fire, brother of Dazhbog; his worship was principally
connected with the domestic hearth.</p>

<p>But the deity who stands out most prominently, who became
the supreme divinity of the race, though corresponding to the
Scandinavian Thor, was Perkunas, or Perun, whose name,
yielding to certain laws of phonetic change, may correspond to
Greek Keraunos (thunder), but more closely to Sanskrit Parjanya,
called in the Rig-Veda, “The thunderer, the showerer,
the bountiful, who impregnates the plants with rain.” This god
was forgotten by the Hellenic Aryans, who exalted Dyaus (Zeus,
Jove) to the supreme position, but the Letto-Slavonic tribes bestowed
upon him the endearing appellation of the “All-Father,”
a title which they only conferred upon the creator of the lightnings.
It is said that the Russians still say, when the thunder
rolls, “<i>Perkuna gromena;</i>” in Lithuanian, “<i>Perkuns grumena</i>.”</p>

<p>The South-Slavic term for the rainbow is “Perunika,” “Perun’s
flower,” or “beauty.”</p>

<p>“White-Russian traditions,” says Afanasief,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> “describe Perun
as tall and well shaped, with black hair and a long golden
beard. He rides in a flaming car, grasping in his left hand a
quiver full of arrows, and in his right a fiery bow.”</p>

<p>He is also represented as carrying a mace, answering to
Thor’s hammer, mjolnir.</p>

<p>After the introduction of Christianity the prophet Elijah became
credited with many of the honors and functions of Perkunas.
He was termed, “Gromovit Ilija” (Thunder Elijah),
and the origin of the notion, and the strange metamorphosis of
that sweet spirit into a Boanerges, undoubtedly lie in his flight
to heaven in a chariot of fire, and in his power, when on earth,
of calling down fire from heaven, and of bringing the rain.
Thus, II. Kings, i:10, he says, “If I be a man of God, then shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty.”
Again, Kings, i., 18:41, “And Elijah said unto Ahab: Get thee
up; eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain.”</p>

<p>The Slavs considered that the thunder and lightning were
given into the prophet’s hands, and that he closed the gates of
heaven, <i>i. e.</i>, the clouds, to sinful men, who thus might not share
in his blessed reign. There is evidence of the same belief
among the Teutonic tribes, and in the old High-German poem,
“Muspilli,” a form of that saga which prevailed throughout all
the middle ages with regard to the appearance of anti-Christ
shortly before the end of the world. Elijah takes the place which
Thor assumes in Scandinavian myth at Ragnarok, and fights
the evil one:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Daz hôrtih rahhôn dia werol trehtwison,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Daz sculi der anti-Christo mit Eliase pâgan.”</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I have heard the very learned say,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That anti-Christ shall with Elijah fight.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The poem then proceeds to say that Elijah shall be wounded,
and recounts the many signs and wonders that shall occur before
the Muspell-doom, the Judgment Day.</p>

<p>Volos, or Veles, was another solar deity. It has been held
that the Greek Helios appears in this name, while others have
identified him with Odin, or Woden, pronounced with an epenthetic
<i>l</i>, and with other changes, but the etymology seems far-fetched.</p>

<p>He was the special protector of cattle. The name survives
to Christian times in St. Blasius. Mr. Ralston says: “In Christian
times the honors originally paid to Volos were transferred
to his namesake, St. Vlas, or Vlasy (Blasius), who was a shepherd
by profession. To him the peasants throughout Russia pray
for the safety of their flocks and herds, and on the day consecrated
to him (February 11) they drive their cows to church, and
have them secured against misfortune by prayer and the sprinkling
of holy water.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Afanasief considers that the name was
originally one of the epithets of Perun, who, as the cloud-compeller—the
clouds being the cattle of the sky—was the
guardian of the heavenly herds, and that the epithet ultimately
became regarded as the name of a distinct deity.”</p>

<p>By the names of Volus and Perun the Russians used to swear
and confirm their sayings and treaties by oath.</p>

<p>Stribog was the wind-god. According to Russian ideas the
four winds are the sons of one mother, and in the Old-Russian
Igor song the wind is addressed as Sir. These winds are called
Stribog’s grandsons. So in India, the winds are regarded as
sentient beings; thus in the Nalopákhyánam:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thus adjured, a solemn witness, spake the winds from out the air.</div>
<div class="spaced">*************</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Even as thus the wind was speaking, flowers fell showering all around,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the gods’ sweet music sounded on the zephyr light.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Byelbog and Chernobog, the representatives of light and
darkness, are of antagonistic nature—the warring principles
of good and evil. Byelbog is the white, shining god, the bringer
of the day, the benignant Phœbus, while Chernobog, a black
god, belongs to the diabolical order.</p>

<p>The goddess of spring and love was Lada—corresponding
closely to Freya in the Scandinavian traditions. Lovers and
the newly married addressed their prayers to her, praising her
name in songs. Lado, the Slavonic counterpart of Norse
Freyr, has many of the same attributes as the goddess Lada, to
whom the same adoration and praise were offered. Mr. Ralston
says that “one Lithuanian song distinctly couples the name
Lado with that of the sun. A shepherd sings, ‘I fear thee not
O wolf! The god with the sunny curls will not let thee approach.
Lado, O Sun-Lado!’ In one of the old chronicles
Lado is mentioned as the god of marriage, of mirth, of pleasure,
and of general happiness, to whom those about to marry offered
sacrifices in order to secure a fortunate union.”</p>

<p>Kupàlo was the god of harvests, and before the harvest—on
the 23d of June—sacrifices were offered to him. Young people
lighted fires and danced around them in the evening, adorned
with garlands of flowers, singing harvest ditties to the god.
This custom still survives in the fires kindled on St. John’s eve,
through which sometimes the people jump and drive their cattle.
The Poles and other Slavonians, especially in remote districts,
keep up many of their ancient heathen rites.</p>

<p>The 24th of December was sacred to the goddess Kolyada, a
solar deity, to whom songs were sung in celebration of the renewed
life of the sun after the winter solstice “when the gloom
of the long winter nights begins to give way to the lengthening
day.” This festival became blended with the Christmas celebration
upon the advent of Christianity, and songs are still to
be heard at that time containing the name of the goddess, as</p>

<p class="unindent">These ditties are called Kolyadki.</p>

<p>Inferior deities were believed in and many supernatural beings
were supposed to haunt the woods and waters. The
Russalkas, which are naiads, though no more seen, are still
believed in, and are of a nature similar to the elves and fairies
of western nations. “They are generally represented under the
form of beauteous maidens, with full and snow-white bosoms,
and with long and slender limbs. Their feet are small, their
eyes are wild, their faces are fair to see, but their complexion is
pale, their expression anxious. Their hair is long and thick
and wavy, and green as is the grass.” The Russians are very
superstitious in regard to them, fearing to offend them, while
the maidens go into the woods and throw garlands to them,
asking for rich husbands in return.</p>

<p>Then there are Mavkas, or Little-Russian fairies and water-nymphs,
wood demons, house spirits and numerous other minor
spirits and powers which teem in the folk songs of the peasants.</p>

<p>Among the eastern Slavs there seem to have been no temples
or priests, while the contrary was true of the west. They
burned their dead and greatly reverenced the spirits of the departed,
in whose honor festivals were held.</p>

<p>A form of Sutteeism undoubtedly prevailed, widows destroying
themselves in order to accompany their husbands to the
spirit land, while slaves were sometimes sacrificed upon the
same occasions—a practice common to most barbarous states
of society.</p>

<p>Upon a general view of ancient Slavonic mythology we observe
the same characteristics as among all the other Indo-European
tribes—the same nature-worship and inclination to
personify the powers of the air and sky; to worship the beneficent
sun, which brings to man prosperity, light and happiness;
to execrate the night, the enemy of the bright, the beautiful god
of day. Men in the childhood of the human race were as simple
as children ever have been. The same characteristics mark
them. When the mother leaves her child for a moment, the
babe with piteous cries calls on her to return. Why is this so?
Because in the mind of the child there is no connecting link
between the ideas of her going and returning; in other words,
the child cannot reason enough to consider it possible—not to
say probable, <i>certain</i>—that she will return.</p>

<p>Thus in the simple pastoral days of extreme antiquity, when
the glorious sun, the light of men’s eyes, the joy of their hearts,
sank below the horizon, the idea of its return failed to suggest
itself to their minds. Each sun-setting was a grief, each rising
of the blessed orb a joy unspeakable.</p>

<p>And thus upon the plains of Iran, in the flowery meads of
Asia Minor and on the Russian steppes, when man beheld the
sun, his joy appeared, he fell on his face and thanked the regent
of the sky for his light again.</p>

<p>Had the earth been nearer to the sun the face of Comparative
Mythology had been changed; the sun-myth would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had to seek a different origin and home, and the history of
that greatest of all studies—the study of man—would have had
a different course.</p>

<p>It is sincerely to be hoped that the future of the Slavonic
tribes may be such as God and nature have intended for them,
and that their name may be changed again from <i>slaves</i> to <i>Slavs</i>—“men
of glory”—is the aspiration of all who have hopes for
the race; in short, of all who wish well to our common humanity.</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_THE_BALTIC_TO_THE" id="FROM_THE_BALTIC_TO_THE">FROM THE BALTIC TO THE
ADRIATIC.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>We hesitated quite awhile before deciding to expend fifty
thalers for a trip from Berlin to Danzig, finally concluding that
the historical interest of Marienburg, through which we would
pass on our return, and the reputed picturesqueness of Danzig
would compensate us for the time and money. At an early
hour one September morning we drove across the busiest portion
of Berlin (and most unknown to the traveler), to take our
train at the <i>ost bahn</i>. I had seen this portion of the large city
once before, when we started to visit the country of the Wends,
the original people in all the region by the Baltic.</p>

<p>The tedious stretch of sand (broken here and there by a
peasant’s house with red tile roof), was the same we had traversed
so often in leaving Berlin for a neighboring town or city,
the inevitable “plains of Moab” which discouraged Frederick
the Great’s French gardeners. How such a thriving, populous
city as Berlin has ever asserted itself in the sand, is a curious
study. We passed Bismarck’s estate in Pomerania,
“Schönhausen,” and one of the party reflected upon the great
statesman, the largest factor in German political life; while the
other remembered the sad and dejected royal pair which was
driven by Napoleon’s fury to take this same route to Memel.
The lovely Queen Louise and Frederick William III. were there
with their royal children, praying that the tyrant’s hand might
be stayed, and they brought back to their rightful kingdom.
Alas! death claimed the beautiful queen before the peace for
which she prayed was restored to Prussia. But in her son, the
present emperor, there has been perpetuated the spirit of his
mother. Prussia’s high position to-day has been secured not
altogether by the might of her great army, nor the tremendous
genius of her great statesmen, nor the ambition of her king, but
by the growth of sentiment during the reigns of Frederick William
III. and IV., and by the precept Queen Louise instilled
into her sons during those dark and sorrowful days of exile in
Memel: “My sons, let the spirit of Frederick the Great animate
you,” etc.</p>

<p>Memel, Tilsit, and Königsberg were passed, and finally the
blue Baltic and Danzig were in sight. We had almost looked
for amber-colored water, so long had we associated the beautiful
display of amber jewels in the Berlin shop windows with
the Baltic, from which it is taken. Even Homer refers to the
Baltic as the resting place of amber, its bed being laid with the
sunny stone.</p>

<p>A multitude of ship-masts rose from the coast, and from
beyond the pointed gables of the old city, lessening in altitude
as the vista lengthened. This first glimpse was a more fascinating
picture than we were afterward able to find. Yet the hotel
helped the preconceived idea that Danzig was really a second
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>The broad stone steps, or stairway, which started from the
<i>portecochère</i>, were whitened by ashes, as one so often sees them
in Germany—a pretty state of things for a lady descending in
a black dress. The room we were to occupy was an immense
ball-room, utilized in quiet times for a bed-room. Two candles
burned in their tall candlesticks on the center-table, and by the
light of the twilight we could see across the street some beautiful
and curious carvings in the opposite gabled houses. The
price paid for accommodations was large enough to have enabled
us to see castles in the air, and to have our ball-room illuminated
with gas until morning. We concluded they seldom
had guests in this hotel, and therefore made heavy profits when
some did come along.</p>

<p>That evening we wandered around the old crooked streets—paved
in cobble-stones, which wore our shoes almost in pieces—until
we were glad to pause in front of the great old red-brick
cathedral. Its towers cut the big yellow moon in two at every
angle we could see them. We stretched our heads to take in the
tremendous dimensions of the cathedral, and the ornamentations
of some of the best houses, until we suddenly remembered
that it was nearing midnight, and that we had been in actual
service at sight-seeing and traveling since an early hour that
morning, so we returned to our ball-room and two candles. The
next morning, we imagined, we would have a great treat in
hunting up old carved furniture, for which Danzig, we had been
told by our German friends, was equal to Augsburg; but the
antiquarians had left no place unexplored. No trace of massive-legged
table or curiously-carved chairs was to be found, save
in the Museum and the Rathhaus (Council Hall). The stairway
of the Council Hall remains indeed a monument to the ingenious
designer and skillful carver, and the judge’s chair is
most curious.</p>

<p>A fine old convent has been turned into a museum. Its <i>kreuz
gänge</i>, or cross-passages, give the place a most mysterious, sequestered
air, and they are gradually collecting some great
pictures and treasures within its walls. But the Rathhaus, in
its architecture, surpasses everything in Danzig, excepting,
perhaps, its fine old gateways.</p>

<p>The most distinguished houses in Danzig have on either side
of the entrance, at a distance of five feet, immense stones hewn
out of solid rock. They are nine feet, probably, in circumference.
A chain is attached, which is given a graceful swing before
being fastened again to either side of the front door, about
as high up as the brass knocker. As these big round stones
grow smaller in perspective, they give a peculiar air to a street.
They seem to be peculiar to Danzig, unless one or two dwellings
in Edinburgh have them. The big stones, the large chains, the
tremendous brass knockers, and the innumerable windows in
the six stories of the pointed gables, suggest aristocratic dwellings,
and surpass the houses in Nuremberg.</p>

<p>An important political meeting at Stettin defeated our intention
of seeing Marienburg on our return to Berlin. Marienburg
is a place few foreigners find out, but Lübke, in his “History of
Art,” represents the architecture of the palace occupied by the
knights, or crusaders, for two centuries, as one of the most exquisite
ruins in all Germany. Thorn and Königsburg were
also homes for this order of knights.</p>

<p>The following day at noon it was rather refreshing to drive
into so modern and gay a place as Berlin, and forget that so
many people must exist in places like Danzig. Mediæval life
seems still to enwrap them there as in a garment. Their eyes
are closed to any modern idea or project.</p>

<p>Berlin contains all that is new and progressive in Germany.
That day as we sat in the garden of the “Thiergarten Hotel,”
eating delicious salmon, the old emperor drove by in his open
carriage, with his faithful <i>jäger</i>. He was still a subject for curiosity,
as it was so soon after the attempt had been made to assassinate
him, June 7, 1878. He was fired on as he drove by
in this same open carriage with this same faithful <i>jäger</i>. The
sight of the old emperor recalled the previous months which
had been so full of political stir in Europe. The session of the
Berlin Congress, and the occupation of Bosnia by the Austrians
had taken place.</p>

<p>To describe Berlin to those who have not visited it, is simply
telling, generally, the size of palaces, the number of art collections,
the width of streets, the squares occupied by statues, the
places of amusement, etc., but even when these objects and interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
are put in writing they leave little impression until the
place is seen. But there is another aspect of the great Prussian
capital. It is a wonderful place just now, attracting so many
foreign students to its university, the best musical talent to its
conservatories, and the first military genius within its walls.
No matter what branch of study one may choose, the instruction
and illustration is right at hand. To the student of politics it
is a most fruitful field, not only because distinguished statesmen
frequent its streets every day, but because grave problems in
political science are discussed in the Reichstag or taught in the
University. The student of physics or of natural science can
work under Helmholz and others; the student of music can
secure Joachim or Clara Schumann, or the student of art,
Knaus, or Richter. Berlin has no pulpit orator. The Dom is
more frequented because of its tombs than for any living influence
it extends. It contains the coffins of Frederick William
the great elector, and Frederick I., king of Prussia. The Mendelssohn
choir chants its anthems, and the emperor and empress
bow at its communion table; but St. Hedwig’s Church is better
attended. The American Chapel, built by the efforts of Mr.
Whright, our American minister to the Prussian court, a devout
Methodist, is still occupied and attended by travelers of the
American-English type.</p>

<p>The annual exhibition of pictures in the academy, the many
fine concerts, the treasures in the old museum, the Royal Library,
the palaces, and the lovely drives along “Unter den
Linden,” are only mentioned to show what Berlin does contain
in the way of sights and pleasures. This Unter den Linden,
the street so well known, was planned by Frederick
William, in the seventeenth century, and is now worn by many
royal carriages and busy hurrying mortals. The street about
the opera house is crowded every morning by the eager buyers
of tickets, which must be secured in the morning.</p>

<p>Surely life in Berlin can be made very attractive, but after a
long residence there I am convinced that it has little religious
life. The climate is depressing, the expense of living great,
two other detractions. Potsdam, Sans Souci, Charlottenburg
Tegel, and many other places in the suburbs, are, historically
and naturally, charming resorts.</p>

<p>It is more compensating in Europe to go from place to place
with some special work or subject in view than to go for mere
sight-seeing. Your special work brings you nearer the people.
If your landlady asks you what it is, and you take the trouble
to tell her, she or some of her friends will at once see that you
know all their acquaintances who are engaged in the same line
of inquiry, and while the new acquaintances may not be socially
or intellectually your ideals, yet their conversation will
help you in the language and give you many opportunities.</p>

<p>Dresden I only know through hard work in the galleries, as
though all its sights are familiar—the Schloss, Green Vaults
with their immense treasures, the Military Museum, Museum of
Natural History, the Grand Opera House, the Frauenkirche,
Japanese Palace, cafés, coinages and statues; yet the picture
gallery, with its priceless “Madonna di San Sisto” of Raphael
is to me the starting point of interest and the essence of Dresden
life.</p>

<p>From eight o’clock in the morning until four o’clock in the
afternoon faithful copyists labor in the gallery. The price received
for their work scarcely keeps them from starving. To
go in among them for a time and work and feel as they do, enlarges
one’s sympathies, and teaches one to love the masterpieces
of the great artists. To the uninitiated in such matters
it may be well to explain that before the permission is given to
copy a picture in any of the European galleries, a good deal of
red tape must be looked after, especially in Germany. The director
demands a specimen of the applicant’s work, which must
be a study from nature, either figure or landscape or still life.
It is with considerable trepidation that the office of the “Herr
Director” is entered. If the applicant is successful, he or she
comes out with an elaborate paper containing the agreement, the
name of picture to be copied, the number, room, etc., with the director’s
name and the seal attached. One of the <i>gallerie diener</i>,
as they are called in Germany, takes you under his care, arranges
an easel, a piece of carpet, a rest-stick and table. You are recognized
among the copyists, and the hat of every <i>gallerie diener</i>
is raised at your approach or departure. When you have finished,
the inspector is allowed to criticise your work. You
must pay the <i>diener</i> who has waited upon you some <i>trink geld</i>,
or a fee, as we would express it. At noon you can eat your cold
lunch, in company with the other copyists, in front of a Raphael
or a Correggio, a Titian or a Rubens, scrutinize its merits
or laugh at its blunders, or speculate on the old master’s methods
of using their pigments, without being amenable to any
court. An artist’s life is a life of liberty—of thought, at least.
Many of these copyists spend their afternoons in sketching,
thus establishing their originality and emancipating themselves
from servile observance of other men’s methods. In company
with these plodding, intelligent artists, I have spent many delightful
hours sketching in the “Alt Markt,” or the Zwinger, or
at Sans Souci or Charlottenburg.</p>

<p>I have often wondered if the little Greek church in the suburbs
of Dresden was as attractive to all travelers as to me. It is
surrounded on one side by golden wheat fields, with red poppies
and dark blue corn flowers growing among it. Its gilded dome,
semi-domes, and minarets, shine like blazing lights against the
dark blue sky. The style is such pure Byzantine and the inside
so perfect in its appointments, and yet so simple; the service
conducted in so solemn and devout a spirit, there seems to be
much to impress the looker-on. There are no seats. On one
side stand the women and on the other side the men, and before
the altar the patriarch, or priest. The service is short,
consisting almost entirely of singing by the men and boys,
without the aid of an instrument. When the plate is passed for
the collection it contains a roll of bread, the meaning of which
I have never discovered, although James Freeman Clark may
give it in the account of the Greek church in his “Ten Great
Religions.” Their belief that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father, and not from the Father and Son, seems to be the most
essential difference in prayer between the English Church and
the Greek.</p>

<p>A summer in the Harz Mountains, taking in Weimar and
Eisenach, and the “Wartburg,” is a charming experience. To
find out that one can live in this age in so interesting a retreat
as Weimar, for twenty dollars a month, gives back some of the
simplicity to German life.</p>

<p>To a student of Goethe, Schiller, Wieland and Herder, no
spot offers more pleasure than the quiet, old streets and groves
and houses of Weimar. A mere drive through the park, passing
Goethe’s summer house and on out to “Tiefert,” where the
Grand Duchess Amelia held her little court, and the open air
theater attracted a charming coterie to listen to Goethe or
Schiller in some representation, re-awakens the genius of the
times and arouses the appetite of the traveler for more acquaintance
with the place. The next drive or stroll through
the park will prove that every stone contains some rhyme, and
every bench some association with those great men. There is
a line to Frau Von Stein in the garden of Goethe’s country
house, an elegy engraved on the stone as one ascends to the
Roman house in the park. The front approach to this house is
not so attractive, but the back is a fascinating place. It contains
on the first floor an open room with round table and
benches, where the Duke and his poets sat for hours, looking
over the old stone steps into the park. A short stroll from there
brings one to the large open space, in the middle of the park,
which was laid out by Goethe, and represents precisely the dimensions
of St. Peter’s in Rome. The immense ground plot
of that church is here to be recognized more definitely than
when one stands under its dome.</p>

<p>The grand ducal palace at Weimar contains one unique room,
while all the others are handsome. The one which differs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
similar palatial apartments is frescoed with scenes from the
works of Weimar’s great poets. The halls are silent and one
longs to see little fat Karl August step out of a <i>saal</i> or the
Duchess Amelia greet Goethe or Schiller on the stairway as in
days of yore. Mr. Lewis, in his life of Goethe, portrays such
scenes with a graphic pen.</p>

<p>In 1832 the house in the Goethe-platz was left vacant by its
great occupant. Its art treasures, its library, its various collections,
showing how comprehensive Goethe’s mind was, and
how many things he had investigated, were abandoned, as all
human efforts must be abandoned, when the silent messenger
calls the soul into the presence of its Great Creator. If self-denial
is required of those on earth who hope to enter into his
rest, then who can answer for Goethe? But surely the choir of
angels in “Faust” sing beautifully of it:</p>

<p>This house still stands as he left it, and is shown every Friday
afternoon to visitors. It has been occupied by his grandson
for years.</p>

<p>The church in which Lucas Cranach’s great picture is to be
seen, and in which Herder preached, is a cold, heartless structure
to a stranger, but its very stones and walls must respond
to the prayers of the old inhabitants. The <i>brunnen</i>, or town
well, in front of Lucas Cranach’s house, when surrounded by a
crowd of peasants offers a <i>genre</i> picture for an artist. The
picture gallery is new and good. A large fresco representing
Weimar celebrities is in the front entrance. Bettina Von Arnim
is the only woman in the group. Perhaps her correspondence,
which is by many considered spurious, will make the
artist regret that he has given her so important a position in
this fresco. To take an early breakfast in some lovely arbor,
overlooking some historic grounds, then spend the morning in
the gallery and the afternoon in the park, and the evening at
the concert, is about the happiest program one can follow in a
small German town.</p>

<p>Eisenach, the capital of Saxe-Weimar, a town of 10,000 inhabitants,
will always remain associated with Martin Luther.
It is the principal town in the Thuringian forest. The old
“Wartburg,” one and a half miles south of the town, is famous
for its architecture and history. Martin Luther, the Elector of
Saxony, who rescued him, and earlier the saintly Elizabeth and
her cruel husband, are only a few names which are associated
with it. Of course the story of the Elector of Saxony rescuing
Luther, after the Diet of Worms, is well known. Yet who can
resist dwelling upon this bold character at this period. After
the Pope’s excommunication Luther defies all threats and starts
out on his return journey, with the emperor’s promise of a safe-conduct;
the decree for arrest follows closely every step.
What a picture! to have these armed knights attack him and
carry him prisoner to the old Wartburg. Then to discover afterward
that a friend’s hand, and not an enemy’s, had done this thing.
There he remained ten months, and there still remain the traces
on the wall of the ink he threw at the devil. Perhaps the chapel,
where he preached on Sundays, is a more becoming and decorous
place to associate him with than this little room, always
pointed out first.</p>

<p>The Wartburg has been so beautifully renovated of late at
the expense of the government, it is really worth a second visit
to those who may have seen it years ago. The banquet hall is
certainly superb, and the St. Elizabethangeng, with its beautiful
frescoes and long narrow proportions, almost enables one to see
the good woman walking up and down with her prayer-book,
in deep meditation, before starting out through the forest with
her attendants, and her apron full of provisions for the poor.
It is told that once, when her liege-lord met her, and inquired
what she had in her apron (he had strictly forbidden her taking
things to the poor), she, with legendary faith, opened her apron
and forthwith the bread became roses.</p>

<p>Taking your faithful donkey which has brought you up the
hill, and your Wartburg album collection of photographs, you
find yourself soon wandering through the lovely and fantastic
<i>Annenthal</i>, and finally resting near the depot at Eisenach.
There the untiring finger of your old guide points to Fritz
Reuter’s house, and at last to his own little bill, which he has
carefully prepared and which he expects you as carefully to
pay. Never goes money from your pocket more liberally!</p>

<p>The Harz Mountains, their legends and songs, have been so
often written of there is danger of stupid repetition if one goes
over the ground.</p>

<p>A novel experience for an American is to have an attack of
rheumatism in the house of an old Polish major in midsummer,
in Wernigerode, and be attended by the physician of Count
Von Stolberg. To inform those who may be so unfortunate as
to meet with a similar fate what will become of them, I would
simply remark that the subterfuge of every German doctor,
when he finds a case getting beyond his control, is to recommend
a water-cure. The one at Magdeburg being the nearest
to Wernigerode, is the one which Count Von Stolburg’s physician
would be best acquainted with, so off to the old city and
farewell to the Harz! What rheumatic patient cares for a view
of a fine old cathedral from a window, or to be informed that
the city has existed since the eighth century? Do these facts
lessen the pain or quiet the nerves? After the bath has restored
the patient, and he or she can walk out and examine the cathedral,
and read of the sufferings of the people in the sixteenth
or seventeenth centuries, and again how the Austrian army was
resisted by Wallenstein for seven months, and how the French
besieged and took it in 1806, and again in 1813—thus there is
diversion in finding oneself on such historic grounds and picturesque
surroundings.</p>

<h2><a name="FAILINGS" id="FAILINGS">FAILINGS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By J. MORTIMER GRANVILLE.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>We all have our <i>failings</i>, and for the most part we regard
them tenderly. They do not count as offences; scarcely are
they held to be faults. It is always a probable conjecture that
an error of omission has been unintentional; not unfrequently
it seems possible it was unavoidable. A sentiment of pity for,
and even sympathy with, weakness overpowers the sense of
grievance; the voice of the inward monitor is silenced, and the
self-excused conscience sleeps. Meanwhile failings are the
worst and most mischievous, the deadliest and least curable, of
the ills to which the moral nature of man is heir. They are the
sources of evil whence spring the blackest vices of human
character, the false roots that nourish and sustain its parasites,
and steal the sap of its inner life. A failing is not merely negative;
its sinister aspect is one of positive wrong-doing, wherein
some behest of the will is disobeyed, a measure of moral power
wasted, a rebel habit formed or fostered. To compassionate
failings in others is to beg the question of fact for the sake of
politeness; to look with leniency on the errors which self would
fain palliate, by assuming that they are unavoidable, is to play
the traitor to Truth, and let the enemy into the citadel; whereas
conscience is set to guard the nature of man from treachery not
less carefully than to protect it against assault.</p>

<p>Failings may be moral, mental, or physical, as they show
themselves in the character, the intellect, or the bodily habit
and powers. It generally happens that what strikes the observer
as a failing is compounded of errors in feeling, thought,
and action combined. The practical question is how the overt
evil came into existence; or, if happily the failing should be
detected in an earlier stage of growth, before it has betrayed its
presence by ugly consequences, we may ask: what are the mischievous
forces, where are they at work, how can they be counteracted?
Why has this person the “failing” of a tendency to
excessive indulgence in drink or the gratification of some unbridled
passion; and that individual a seeming inability to recognize
and pursue the right and honest course of conduct in the
presence of any so-called “temptation” or difficulty?</p>

<p>Some of the most regrettable and injurious failings which disfigure
and defame the character run through families, appearing
in successive generations and seeming to be inherited.
This theory of their perpetuation is well founded; and it has
been adduced as conclusive evidence of the truth of the
hypothesis that mind, and, of course, character, is the mere
outcome of matter. The force of the argument obviously rests
on the assumption that nothing more than, or outside, matter
can be transmitted from parent to child; that a particular constitution
of brain and nerve centres, a special arrangement or
combination of the elements which compose the mind-organ,
may be reproduced, and, if it is, a similarity of character will
be entailed; but as for the independent existence of mind, or
spirit, that is a pure figment of the imagination, which science
will sooner or later drive beyond the pale of credulity, and to
which, even now, only a few thinkers avowedly cling!</p>

<p>Let us examine this proposition at close quarters. It may be
stated thus. All we know of mind is expressed, and understood,
by physical agencies and in the formulæ of material force.
Speech communicates thought, and we think in words. The
faculty of forming and employing words is a brain function.
If a particular region of the brain be injured or diseased, the
power of using language, at least in speech, is <i>generally</i> lost.
The materialist argues from this and many similar facts that
mind is the product of matter. He fails to perceive that the
only warrantable deduction from his own data is that mind or
spirit, call it what we will, <i>can only express itself</i> through the
brain as an instrument. As well deny the skill or independent
existence of a musician because he can not play the full score of
an opera on a flute, as infer the non-existence of a soul from the
fact that man cannot perform intellectual work without the
organ of thought—the brain!</p>

<p>The capacity of the instrument doubtless limits the expression,
but it supplies no measure of the power or skill of the performer,
except in so far as the use he makes of the instrument
may be a bad one. This exception is of great significance, and
there will be something more to say about it presently. Meantime
it is evident that, while the range of brain-power determines
the <i>manifestation</i> of mind, it neither measures, nor
affirms, nor disproves the independent existence of mind. The
anatomist, the physiologist, and the chemist declare their inability
to discover the traces of a soul in the physical organism.
That no more proves the non-existence of a soul than the failure
to recognize more than a certain number of planets at any
stage in the history of astronomy demonstrated that there was
nothing further to find.</p>

<p>The appeal against materialism lies to the instinct of common
sense. If mind were the mere outcome of matter, science would
long since have discovered some tolerably constant relation
between peculiarities of physical development and manifestations
of character; whereas every step onward in the progress
of research tends to disprove the existence of any certain dependency
or connection between morals and matter. Even
such links as compose the stock-in-trade of the physiognomist
and phrenologist are shown to be illusory, except in so far as
they may be the effects, rather than the causes, of character,
and are produced by culture—witness the effects of education
on facial expression in the case of criminals. The theory of a
criminal conformation of cranium has been abandoned like the
silly affectation of being able to detect an offender by his “hang-dog”
or “murderous” look.</p>

<p>“Failings” must be studied in the light of the lessons these
facts and considerations combine to teach. The moral question
involved is one of responsibility for the use each individual
may make of the brain-power allotted to him. The neglect to
employ gifts and capacities is as grave an error, from an ethical
point of view, as their application to a bad purpose. The
servant who buried his talent in the earth was held accountable
for the failure to use it, and thereby increase its value. The
parable sets forth a truth of the highest practical interest. We
are responsible for the development, by use, of the faculties
vouchsafed to us. If they are allowed to remain in abeyance,
or a rudimentary state, we are to blame for the deficiencies and
the failings to which this neglect gives rise, and are without
excuse. The obligation to act up to the level of known duty
cannot be avoided. A “failing” is an act of contempt for the
law of development by use. It is disobedience to an understood
command. The fact that it is recognized makes a failing an
offence. There may be short-coming in the performance of a
good resolve. Few, if any, merely human efforts are entirely
successful; but the failure which occurs when an endeavor is
made in the energy of a resolute and well-aimed purpose is not
so much a fault as insufficiency. The rising tide reaches its
highest level by successive efforts. Self-improvement is effected
in the same fashion. The motive power of persistent good endeavor
is accumulative—ever advancing like the great tidal
wave of the ocean—though the ground is conquered by short
and seemingly only half-successful advances.</p>

<p>Failings, however, as we are now regarding them, are excused
faults in the character which the individual makes no
serious effort to repair. Some defects, as we have seen, are
inherited, and upon them it is the custom to bestow great commiseration
and little blame. Now, in truth, these are the least
pardonable, because, if they are known to have been transmitted
from parent to child, the latter has, generally, the advantage
of an example, ever present to memory, by which to correct
his personal deficiencies. If the “failing” be a vicious
propensity, he can recall its hideousness, and thus stimulate
will and conscience to aid him in eradicating the fault. If it be
some form of deficiency, as indolence, lack of perseverance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
want of principle, or the like, he can study, as in the pages of
history, the evil consequences entailed by the defect, and with
diligence order his own conduct in better courses. Inherited
failings are the least excusable. Even the materialist, who
claims them as the fruit of physical peculiarities, must concede
that by special culture they can be remedied, the healthy organism
being susceptible of increased development in any
particular direction when the proper stimuli are intelligently
applied with a view to its improvement. The apologist for
failings which have been inherited can find no comfort in the
philosophy of materialism.</p>

<p>Failings which are peculiar to the individual may be less easy
to detect, and the subject of these defects is, in a measure, dependent
upon experience and the monitions of those around
him for the information needed to correct them. This should
keep the wise teachable and apt to profit by the lessons life is
ever reading for their instruction. A self-reliant spirit is manly,
and therefore commendable; a self-sufficient spirit is unreasonable,
and therefore despicable. It is strange how few of us
grow really wiser as we grow older. The work of self-improvement
is seldom commenced until forced upon the judgment by
some awakening experience, and this is rarely vouchsafed until
the ductile period of youth has gone by. Early in the adult age
of man his habits become rigidly formulated, and failings are
then hard to mend. A world of unhappiness and disappointment
might be spared the later years of life if the young would
be warned to begin the business of training the character before
it is firmly set in the mould of circumstances, with all the
coarse elements—inherited and contracted—uneliminated, and
the errors of inconsistency and imperfect development uncorrected.</p>

<p>It is in the period of youth and adolescence that the mind
may be most hopefully cultivated and the moral character intelligently
formed. No greater mistake can be made by a
young and vigorous mind than to treat the faculty of reason and
the instinct of moral judgment as parts of the being which may
be left to their own devices. The young man bestows some
thought on his muscular system—he trains his eye, cultivates
his ear, and takes credit for prudence when he strives to
develop the vigor and to foster the healthy growth of his body.
Is it wise—nay, is it not rather the worst of folly and shortsightedness—to
neglect the ordinary development of those higher
powers which man possesses in a more exalted degree than any
of the lower animals? Taking care for the body while the
mind is neglected is the worst of failings—the most calamitous
and the least excusable.</p>

<h2><a name="SOCIAL_WRECKAGE" id="SOCIAL_WRECKAGE">SOCIAL WRECKAGE.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By ELLICE HOPKINS.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Mr. Francis Peek has recently published a useful but saddening
little book, whose title I have attached to this article. Not
that it tells anything new to one who has studied deeply the
pages of that terrible book of modern life, with its gilded leaves,
but its unutterably dark contents; it only focuses the scattered
knowledge into alarmingly clear vision. Indeed, in reading it,
it is difficult to resist the old nightmare feeling, that after all
this little planet may be the small rotary Vaudeville theater of
the universe, where we poor actors in life’s scene are playing
out a series of farces for the amusement of the angels, or more
probably of darker and more distant visitants. The admirably
logical social life that religiously shuts all the museums and
picture-galleries on the Lord’s Day, and opens all the gin-shops;
that is never tired of iterating that the proper sphere of woman
is home, and brings up its 20,000 female orphans in large pauper
barracks, from which the last touch of home-life has disappeared;
that goes to meetings and loudly preaches thrift to the
people, and then gruffly whispers in their ear by guardians of
the poor, “Only be drunk and spendthrift enough, and we will
house you and provide for your old age;” that goes to church
and preaches that the body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,
and leaves the people to litter down like pigs at night—men and
women, girls and boys, together in tenements where no rich
man would think of stabling his horses; that goes to school and
teaches its children the three R’s, and leaves them in dens of
infamy to learn a fourth R, by every sight and sound of the day
and night, ruin of body and soul; that virtuously declaims
against the harlot, yet leaves its little girls to be brought up in
brothels; that believes a fatal disorder is undermining the national
health, and shuts the doors of its hospitals against it, and
denies it the public means of cure; that legally protects the
heiress up to twenty-one, and refuses to protect the poor man’s
daughter, even at sixteen, from the trade of vice; that holds
that the man is the responsible head of the woman, and throws
the blame and disgrace on the woman—alas! alas! what a heap
of anomalies is here—what real cause to complain of the methods
of our moral life! No wonder that the poor Dissenting
minister, much entangled in our social difficulties, and led on
all sides to contradictory conclusions, threw in a deprecatory
clause in his prayer, “Paradoxical as it may seem to thee, O
Lord, it is nevertheless true.”</p>

<p>And what are the results of such methods as these? What
must be the results?</p>

<p>That we read that in the wealthiest nation in the world, one
in every thirty-one of our countrymen is a pauper; this, moreover,
without including any of that vast number of destitute
persons who are maintained in charitable institutions or by private
benevolence.</p>

<p>That in the richest city in the world there were in one year
101 deaths from actual starvation, in full sight of well-stocked
shops.</p>

<p>That there are about 180,000 apprehensions each year for
drunkenness, and over 15,000 persons yearly charged with indictable
crimes, and over half a million convicted summarily
before the magistrates, of which latter nearly 100,000 are guilty
of personal assaults, about 2,500 being aggravated assaults
upon women and children.</p>

<p>That there are extensive districts in London, Liverpool, and
all our large towns, where our people are living in little more
than half the area of ground required for a corpse, and which
they could claim if they were dead, in tenements which are the
graves of all decency and chastity.</p>

<p>That “in Liverpool alone, by a rough estimate, there are some
10,000 or more children who are neither properly fed, clothed
nor housed, and surrounded by such evil associations at home,
or in the low lodging-houses where they herd, that there is small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
chance of their leading afterwards a useful life, and we can predict
with certainty that many of them will enter our prisons,
penitentiaries and workhouses.”</p>

<p>Surely it must create an uneasy feeling in the most careless
to realize this mass of misery and sin on which the life of the
well-to-do classes in England is based—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That underlies life’s shining surfaces,</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unheeded of the heedless world that treads</span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is impossible for me to deal adequately with the subject in
the narrow space of a short article, but let me touch on three of
our greatest problems—overcrowding, pauperism, and the care
of the young.</p>

<p>First, as to overcrowding. This is a question that distinctly
affects the state, and with regard to which we have to “live in
the whole,” and to see that the welfare of the community is at
stake, and that the state must have an authoritative voice in it.
Virtue, sobriety, decency, are physically impossible in the conditions
under which a vast number of its citizens are living.
The national health and morals are in danger. All the arguments
that justified the interference of the state with the rights
of the Irish landlord, apply equally to the London landlords,
and the artificial forcing up of rents, which has resulted from
the necessity many workmen are under of living near their
work. Yet this question has been the subject of permissive
legislation! The Artisans’ Dwellings Improvement Act, an
honest attempt on the part of Sir Richard Cross to deal with
the problem, was rendered applicable to all towns of 28,000 inhabitants
or upward—that is to say, about eighty towns—but it
was entrusted to the municipalities to carry it out, the town
councils which we have left to be composed chiefly of men of
narrow education, largely swayed by self-interest, and probably
extensive owners of the very property to be demolished! It is
exactly as if the Irish Land Bill had been permissive, and entrusted
to the Irish landlords to put it into execution! Can we
wonder that in about sixty out of the eighty towns, it remains a
dead letter? In eleven it has led to discussion; in two or three
it has led to the demolition of buildings, but not to their erection.
Is there not a want of ordinary <i>seeing</i> in our moral life?
Could we hope to solve a single scientific problem on the methods
on which we are content to live?</p>

<p>“The commercial success,” as Mr. Peek observes, “that has
been achieved by several of the Artisans’ Dwellings Companies
which, while providing good houses, yet pay fair dividends,
shows that the poorest pay rents which give a fair interest on
capital, so that the municipality will not be compelled to embark
in a ruinous undertaking, or one that will not pay in the long
run, to say nothing of the gain to the health and morals of the
nation.”</p>

<p>Secondly, let us take pauperism. First of all let us clearly
recognize that no system of paid officials, no mechanical workhouse
will take the place of human thought and human care.
Nothing will do instead of love. Indeed, there are already signs
that we are working out a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> with these portentous
and ever-increasing warehouses of the destitute and the
vicious that are springing up, throwing the winter support of
whole dissolute families on hard-working rate-payers, and systematically
discouraging thrift. But the problem has been
solved satisfactorily on a small scale, and can be on a larger.
The Elberfield experiment, which in twelve years reduced the
number of paupers from 4,800 to 1,800, notwithstanding that
the population had increased from 50,000 to 64,000, and that
great commercial depression existed, has been too often described
not to be familiar to all. But a remarkable parallel
movement among the Jews is scarcely so well known as it deserves
to be. When “Oliver Twist” was published, the leading
Jews were so mortally ashamed of the picture drawn by the
popular novelist of Fagan and the low Jewish quarters in London,
that they formed themselves at once into an organization
to remedy so disgraceful a state of things. The numbers to be
dealt with amounted to those of a populous town, with the additional
difficulty afforded by immigrant Jews arriving in large
numbers from the Continent in a state of the greatest destitution.
The investigation of every case requiring relief was undertaken
by volunteer workers, assisted by skilled officers, and
was not in the steam pig-killing style, but patient and exhaustive
with true human brotherhood; in deserving cases the relief
given was sufficient to make a guardian’s hair stand on end,
but was given with the view to helping the man to a means of
livelihood. Especially this wise liberality was shown in the
treatment of their widows. Whilst Mr. Peek has no better suggestion
to offer than that the widows’ children should be removed
to the pauper barrack-schools to herd with the lowest children
of casuals, a system which Mr. Peek himself strongly condemns,
the Jews recognized that the mother, if well conducted, was the
proper person to have the care of them, and that her place was at
home. They therefore either provided their widows with indoor
work, or, when that was impossible, relieved them on a sufficient
scale to enable them to look after their children at home; the
consequence being that instead of feeding the outcast class, as
the neglected children of our widows too often do, they grew up
productive and well-conducted members of the community. If,
however, a family was found overcrowding, all relief was steadily
refused till they consented to live a human life, assistance
being given to move into a larger tenement. By these wise and
thoughtful methods in the course of a single generation the Jews
have worked up the people from a considerably lower level to
one decidedly above our own. To be sure the Jew does not
drink. Give the most destitute Jew five pounds down, and at
the end of the year you will find him a small capitalist, having
considerably despoiled the Egyptians meanwhile. But the intemperance
of our people is largely caused by overcrowding,
and by their amusements and recreation-rooms being in the
hands of those who make their profit not by the entertainment
but by the drink traffic, and indefinite improvement may be
brought about by wiser regulations that have the good of the
people, and not the fattening of publicans and brewers at heart.
Surely the success of the Jewish and Elberfeld efforts prove
that the problem of the reduction of pauperism and the inducing
of healthy habits of thrift and self-helping in the people is
soluble, and with that army of devoted Christian workers in our
midst, to whose untiring efforts we owe it that social disaster has
not already overtaken us, it must be possible for us to carry on
the same movement, if Birmingham or one of our public-spirited
towns would lead the way.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the vast, hopeful field, presented by greater
care for the young, and better methods of embodying it.</p>

<p>First, let the law protect the young of both sexes up to the
legal age of majority from all attempts to lead them into a dissolute
life. In most continental countries the corruption of
minors is an indictable offense. The English penal code recognizes
this principle in property; it is felony to abduct an
heiress up to twenty-one, and a young man’s debts, except for
bare necessaries, are null and void till he is of age; but, as usual,
our English law leaves the infinitely more precious moral
personality unprotected. There is no practical protection at
any age for an English child from the trade of vice. An unruly
child of fifteen or sixteen, or even younger, quarrels with her
mother or with her employer, and runs off in a fit of temper.
Even if she leaves her parents’ roof, it can not be brought under
the law against abduction. No one abducts her; the child
abducts herself. Yet the keeper of the lowest den of infamy
can harbor that child for an infamous purpose, and he or she
commits no indictable offence. It is no wonder, therefore, that
the open profligacy of the young forms the very gravest feature
of our large towns. Thankful as we are for the honest effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
deal with this monstrous anomaly in English law, shown by
Lord Rosebery’s bill, we can not but regret the extreme inadequacy
of its provisions, or that the legislature should refuse to
extend legal protection from even the trade of vice, to the most
dangerous age of a girl’s life, the age of sixteen—the age when,
as the medical faculty are agreed, a girl is least morally responsible,
and most liable to sexual extravagances, and when we
can statistically prove that the greatest number of those who go
wrong are led astray. The country will not rest till the legal
protection from the trade of vice is extended to twenty-one.</p>

<p>Secondly, let us recognize it as an axiom that parental rights
do not exist when wholly severed from parental duties; or, in
other words, that the child has its rights as well as the parent,
and that its indefeasible right is, in South’s strong words, “to
be born and not damned into the world.” Let it be recognized,
then, that no child of either sex is to be brought up in a den of
infamy, and to attend school from thence to the contamination
of the children of the respectable poor, the magistrates being no
longer allowed to defeat this beneficent provision of the Industrial
Schools Act, and parental responsibility being recognized by
the parent being compelled to pay toward the Christian and industrial
training of the child; all children living in, or frequenting,
thieves’ dens and disorderly houses to be at once removed.
Let day industrial schools be formed for the lowest class of
children, so as to introduce some classification in our board
schools, the want of which is one of their gravest defects. Let
us adopt emigration to our colonies for our pauper and destitute
children, whenever possible. Any one who has gone into
the question can corroborate Mr. Samuel Smith’s statement in
his able article in the May number of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>,
that “£15 per head covers all expenses, including a few
months’ preparatory training, outfit, passage, etc.” The average
cost of each child in the metropolitan district schools is
nearly £25 per annum. About 11,000 pauper children are
brought up in these large establishments at a cost to the ratepayers
of London of £250,000 per annum. Probably each child
is kept, on the average, five years, costing, say, £120 in all.
Truly Mr. Smith may well add, “with a blindness that is incomprehensible,
the guardians have preferred herding them
together at a vast expense, and refused till quite lately to allow
emigration to be tried.” And for those children who through
bad health, or any other disability, are unable to emigrate, and
can not be boarded out, as well as children whose drunken and
dissolute parents are bringing them up to crime, let there be an
order of teaching deaconesses instituted, and a state-aided
training college, where educated ladies may receive training in
the management of an industrial school, and from which the
guardians can supply themselves with mothers for cottage
homes on the plan of the Village Homes of Ilford, where the
cost of a child is £14, instead of £25. By this arrangement the
children would come under higher influence than the uneducated
workhouse officials. Hundreds of ladies are wanting remunerative
employment, and would gladly undertake this, if
they could be put in the way of the work by a little preliminary
training, and freed from the necessity of “doing the washing”
in the cottage home. And, lastly, let it be a recognized theory
that every Christian household has one respectable but rough
little girl to train under its own upper class servants, to give her
a good start in life, that our houses, with all their culture and
refinement, may no longer be strongholds of <i>l’egoisme à plusieurs</i>,
but centers for teaching good work, high character, and
fine manners—organs for the public good.</p>

<p>And those social atomists who raise their vehement cry about
personal rights and the liberty of the subject over all compulsory
measures for saving children, I would remind that the
question is not of compulsion or non-compulsion; but whether
the natural guardians of a child shall be compelled to pay toward
its Christian and industrial training, or whether they and
I, as ratepayers, shall be compelled to pay for its degradation
in prisons, in infirmary beds, and workhouses. Compulsion
there is anyhow: but surely no reasonable mind can doubt
which compulsion is most in accordance with the true right and
true liberty.</p>

<p>And how can I better close than with the impassioned words
of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, apostrophizing our material
splendor, as shown in the great Exhibition of 1851, by the side
of our moral squalor:</p>

<h2><a name="ECCENTRIC_AMERICANS" id="ECCENTRIC_AMERICANS">ECCENTRIC AMERICANS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By COLEMAN E. BISHOP.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>I.—THE SAILOR, PEDDLER, FARMER, PREACHER.</h3>

<p>In mechanics, an eccentric is a wheel that can start all the
rest of the machinery with a jerk and a kick, and keep it going.
It was the little eccentrics that enabled ten thousand Chautauquans
to scatter to every part of the land in a few hours. The
cam-motion in human nature starts its machinery and scatters
its thought. We ought to thank God for the minds that wabble.
Every originator has been counted eccentric—many of
them have been pronounced insane. The little Festuses sitting
in judgment are always crying to the inspired apostles of truth,
“Thou art beside thyself.”</p>

<p>It is finite mechanism and finite thought that invent geometry
and theology. Men hang, cunningly and truly, their long
counter-shafts of creed, of behavior, of thought, of dress, of consistency,
of loyalty; they bolt and key thereto immovably all
human characters which are round, “line them up” all true
and uniform, lubricate with lucre, put on the steam and away
they all go beautifully and all alike. Woe be to one who wabbles
in this machine-shop of society! But God uses no plumb-lines,
right-angles, levels or true circles. “Nature’s geometrician,”
the bee, never made a true hexagon. The old planets
go “spinning through the grooves of change” in eccentrics, and
never collide. Erratic comets dash through and among them,
and never crash. I suppose the most eccentric character that
ever walked this earth was that strange boy from Nazareth who
confounded the doctors with his unprecedented outgivings. His
teachings were indeed so strange that after the world has been
for one thousand nine hundred years trying to work its standard
up to them, a perfect Christian would to-day be accounted <i>non
compos mentis</i> by the rest of Christendom.</p>

<p>So it is not a bad idea to study eccentric characters, especially
if they are strangely good and oddly useful. One such, at
least, we have at hand for the first study of this series—Rev.
Edward T. Taylor, “Father Taylor,” “The Sailor-Preacher,”
of Boston and the world.</p>

<p>Born in Virginia, reared on the sea, and adopted by New
England. Born a religionist, he preached “play” sermons
when a child; born again a Christian, he preached the gospel
in the Methodist Episcopal Church until all humanity claimed
him. Born a poet, for ten years he studied nature in her tragic
and her melting moods upon the sea; studied man in the forecastle,
in the prison, upon the farm, in the market. Nature
was his university; humanity his text-book; hard experience
his tutor. At the age of twenty he had traveled the world over,
had sounded the depths of human fortune, passion, misery, and
sin; was profoundly learned in his great text-book, and the most
inspired interpreter of its unuttered wants—and did not know the
alphabet! He had become celebrated throughout New England
as a marvelous prodigy in the despised sect of “shouting
Methodists” years before he could read a text or “line” a hymn.
And to the day of his death his preaching knew no method, his
eloquence no logic, his conduct no consistency, and his power
no limit or restraint. To this day no one has succeeded in analyzing
his genius. He could not himself account for his power,
nor could he control it. He seemed to play upon his audiences
at will as a master plays upon the harp; yet some unseen, mysterious
force played upon him in turn. His brethren in the ministry,
who accounted for his strange power by attributing it
to the Holy Spirit, were confounded by the rudeness, jocoseness,
and at times almost profanity of his speech at its highest
flights; and they who undertook to resolve his efforts into the
accepted elements of human power were astounded by the
more than human resources of a mind uncultured and a nature
as wild, as uncontrollable, as bright and as sad as the sea he
loved. Surely, if ever man was inspired, Father Taylor was.</p>

<p>His career, like his methods, answered to all the terms that
can define eccentricity. Deeply religious as the child was by
nature, he ran away to sea at the age of seven. His conversion
was characteristic. Putting into port at Boston, he strolled to a
meeting-house where a revival was in progress; instead of going
in by the door, he listened outside, and when stricken under
conviction, with characteristic impulsiveness he climbed in
through the window. To use his own sailor words: “I was
dragged in through the ‘lubber hole,’ brought down by a broadside
from the seventy-four, Bishop Hedding, and fell into the
arms of Thomas W. Tucker.” This was at the age of nineteen.
Then off to sea as a privateersman in the war of 1812, he was
captured and imprisoned at Halifax, and here his preaching of
the gospel strangely began. A fellow-prisoner read texts to him
till one flashed upon his conception as the cue to his discourse.
“Stop!” the boy would cry; “read that again.” “That will
do;” and he was ready to pour forth a fervid hour of pathos,
wit, brilliant imagery, all supported by perfect acting.</p>

<p>Out of prison at last, he returns to Boston, leaves his seafaring
forever, and takes to the road with a tin peddler’s cart:
clad in a sailor’s jacket and tarpaulin, talking “sea lingo,” religion
and poetry in equal proportions, he traveled over New
England as attractive a sight as Don Quixote would have been.
He came across an old lady who taught him to read (age 21),
and he paid her by gratefully holding meetings in her big
kitchen, and exhorting wondering crowds of rustics and weeping
crowds of penitents. Next he undertook to learn shoemaking,
and then worked a farm for a living—all the time concentrating
his intense nature on his grand passion for playing upon
the human heart; earning little bread for himself, and breaking
the bread of life abundantly to farmers, shoemakers, fishermen;
in farm houses, school houses, barns, camp-meetings;
over a circuit of his own organization. “He was a youthful
rustic Whitefield,” says Bishop Haven, “thrilling rustic audiences
with his winged words and fiery inspiration.” He loved
to preach from the text, “How knoweth this man letters, having
never learned?” Taylor did not know letters, and his speech
was rude and coarse, his blunders innumerable: if words failed
him out of his limited vocabulary, he manufactured them.
Once, completely at fault in his struggle to express the burning
thoughts that crowded his brain he cried, with a perplexed but
irradiated face: “I have lost my nominative case, but I am on
my way to glory!” A few smiled; all wept. His earnestness
atoned for many defects; his imagery was even now beautiful,
and his magnetism irresistible.</p>

<p>Thus young Taylor preached, unlicensed, for five years. It
was the breaking-up and seed-time of New England Methodism.
Between the Puritans and Quakers, with their mutual antagonism,
the shouting Methodists were as corn between the millstones,
a despised and persecuted sect.</p>

<p>About the age of twenty-five occurred three notable events
in his life. He was licensed by the Methodist Conference to
preach. He attended school a short time and began his education.
He married one of God’s noble-women to complete
his education. For ten years he continued the life of a circuit
preacher, growing in culture, power, spirit, and fame, under that
wise and gentle nurture. No one can say how far short of its
fullness Father Taylor’s life might have fallen without Deborah
Taylor.</p>

<p>All these seventeen years of his ministry he had, as far as
possible, kept near to the coast and the haunts of sailors; praying
in the forecastle and preaching on the decks of ships about
to sail, wherever he could reach them. The salt air was incense
to him, and the music of the surf seemed ever dwelling in the
nautilus-chambers of his heart. At last his life-work came in
the direction of his longings. At the age of thirty-fire he was
called to preach to the sailors of Boston. The meetings were
a success from the first, and Mr. Taylor went South and solicited
the money ($2,100) to buy a house for their Bethel. (More bread
cast on the waters to return after many days to the South.) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
work grew, and soon an incorporated society was organized,
called the “Boston Port Society;” from the first nondenominational,
though a majority of its board were Methodists. The
work still grew. Soon the merchants of Boston assumed the
burden of the work, and in 1833 “The Seamen’s Bethel” was
completed at a cost of $24,000. Soon a Seamen’s Savings Bank
and then a Seamen’s Aid Society, a Seamen’s Boarding-house,
and then a Mariner’s Home (at a cost of $34,000), an Industrial
School for Seamen’s Children, and a Seamen’s Co-operative Store,
sprang up around this nucleus. These collateral enterprises
were largely the inspiration of Mother Taylor, but the burden
of them fell upon the Unitarians of Boston, who soon assumed
entire control of the noble charity and mission. Here Father
Taylor fulfilled his life-mission. “From 1829 to 1871 he trod
this quarter-deck, its master.” The fame of the Bethel and its
chaplain, one and the same, went to all quarters of the globe.
Edward Everett styled him “The Walking Bethel,” and Richard
H. Dana in his “Two Years Before the Mast,” said one of the
first inquiries of sailors in foreign ports, from him, was regarding
the welfare of Father Taylor, the mariner’s preacher in
Boston. A sailor declared he had been in ports where the United
States had not been heard of, but never where Father Taylor
had not. Once, soliciting aid for Bethel before another audience
than his own, he glowingly promised: “Drop your gold into
this ocean and it will cast a wave on the shores of Europe which
will strike back to the islands of the Southern Sea, rebound on
the Northwest coast, and so make the circuit of the world and
strike this port again.” The realization of this prediction was
more extravagant than the bold imagery of it. At the dedication
of the Bethel he cried: “America is the center of the
world, the center of America is Boston, and the center of Boston
is the Bethel.”</p>

<p>The first place of a returning sailor’s thoughts became the
Bethel, instead of the groggery. Two of them, seeking it for
the first time, spelled out the name on the flag floating above it:
“<span class="smcap">B-e-t</span>, beat, <span class="smcap">H-e-l</span>, hell; beat-hell! This is Father Taylor’s
place,” and they cast anchor. “There he is, Bill,” said an old
tar to another, as they entered the Bethel; “there’s the old man
walking the deck. He’s got his guns double-shotted and will
give it to us right and left. See how fast he travels—fifteen
knots on a taut bowline. When he walks that way he’s ready
for action.”</p>

<p>There were strange scenes in that vast audience room. The body
of the church was reserved for sailors always, while the side slips
and galleries were for the general public. When the seats were
all filled, he would order the sailors forward like a sea captain,
and crowd the altar rail, the pulpit stairs, the pulpit, and the
pulpit sofas with the weather-beaten mariners, while the grandest
in the land stood and listened in the aisles. “Now,” he
would say, with a beaming face, “we have got the hold full and
a deck load, and we’ll up anchor and start.” Many of the best
critics and reporters have tried to describe and analyze a service
after such a “start”—Dickens, Harriet Martineau, Fredricka
Bremer, Horace Mann, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and others—but
all fail to give us much comprehension of the method
of the man; I suspect because they were all so absorbed they
forgot to take notes, mental or otherwise. But they recall the
<i>effects</i> of the preaching vividly, each in his own way. So much
of the power of Father Taylor was in his presence and action,
that no report of one of his sermons has been made and
preserved. He said himself, “You might as well try to report
chain lightning.” Dr. Bellows said, twelve years ago, “Alas!
nothing remains of him but his memory and his influence. He
will be an incredible myth in another generation.” Why <i>need</i>
this be so? He has left a wealth of original sayings behind him
unequaled by the utterances of few save Abraham Lincoln; and
he may furnish the material for many rare studies in character.
We may be forgiven the presumption of attempting to help rescue
Father Taylor from vanishing into oblivion. What, then,
were the characteristics that lay at the foundations of this remarkable
character? I would classify them under four heads:</p>

<p>1. <i>Intensity.</i> This gave him concentration of thought, earnestness
of belief, courage and aggressiveness in action. He
went into everything with an irresistible impulse. His training
on the sea and in the circuit gave free growth to this trait. He
was never placed where he needed to be politic or conservative;
and his combativeness always had free play. He was the champion
of his despised sect, but he fought with the polished weapons
of a wit, and the impressive presence of a will which the
foes of his cause more dreaded than force. And then his spirit
was so lovable that there is no instance on record of any one
ever having laid hands on him, fierce disputant as he was.</p>

<p>He was a man born to command. His will was imperious.
The last conscious act of his life was to shake his fist at his
nurse, who refused to let him rise from bed. Peter Cartwright
said there were two cataracts in this country—Niagara and
Father Taylor. His brethren called him “the breaking-up
plow of the Church.” Miss Martineau spoke of “the prodigious
force which he carries in his magnificent intellect and earnest
heart.” Another English writer said, “He goes on as energetically
as any ‘Praise-God Barebones’ of the old Covenanter
times.”</p>

<p>I think one thing all his biographers lost sight of was the fact
that his belief became a vital part of him, the very breath of his
nostrils. There is a mighty difference between truly believing,
and simply accepting a belief second-hand, which latter passes
for belief with most people. It is the men who genuinely believe
who make others accept and adopt their belief. In the pulpit his
action is tremendous. He always comes down wet through with
perspiration, and a complete change of wardrobe is necessary
with every effort.</p>

<p>2. <i>Imagination.</i> To this quality is to be referred his profound
religious nature, his poetry, dramatic power, eloquence, and (in
conjunction with his earnestness) even his faults. One called
him a poet; another, a born actor. James Freeman Clarke
said he was the only man he ever heard to whom the much-abused
word, “eloquence,” could be truly applied. But I think
none of these terms so accurately classify his genius as to call
him a painter. His earnestness made everything his quick imagination
conjured up seem realistic to him; and his dramatic
power enabled him to make these images realistic to his hearers.
His thoughts were entities to him, and they always took
the form of objects real and visible. This differs from the <i>poetic</i>
imagination, the essence of which is unsubstantiality.
The poet sees visions, the artist creates forms. Taylor was an
artist, with words for his colors, action for his pencil. One who
heard him said: “While he preached the ocean rolled and
sparkled, the ship spread her sails, the tempest lowered, the
forked lightnings blazed, the vessel struck, her disjointed timbers
floated upon the waves. It was all pictured to the eye as
positive reality. You could hardly believe afterward you had
not actually witnessed the scene.”</p>

<p>He describes a shipwreck, and at the climax, as the ship is
slowly settling in the water, and every face in the audience is
livid with fear, he roars, “Man the life boat!” and every sailor
in the house springs to his feet. Now sailors, under the influence
of drink, have killed their captain. He describes the deed.
They start up before the audience, creeping down the stairs and
into the cabin; he raises the imaginary knife, and half the men
in the house jump forward to arrest the blow, while women
shriek in horror. Once, however, a matter-of-fact, though possessed
sailor, confused Father Taylor. He had depicted the
impenitent sinner, under the figure of a storm-tossed ship, with
her sails split, and driven by the gale toward the rock-bound
coast of Cape Ann. “Oh, how,” he exclaimed, in tones of despair,
“shall this poor sin-tossed sinner be saved?” “Put his
helm hard down, and <i>bear away for Squam!</i>” bellowed the old
salt, springing excitedly to his feet.</p>

<p>So he painted the Mosaic miracles, “till the brethren saw the
snakes squirm, heard the frogs croak, felt the lice bite, brushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the flies out of their faces and saw the Israelites march out of
Egypt.”</p>

<p>One of his last sermons, when he was old and feeble, ended
thus: “My work is almost done. Where are all my old shipmates—they
who lay in hammocks beside me and who have fought at
the same guns? Gone, gone—all gone! No, blessed be God! not
<i>all;</i> there’s one left. [Here he made the picture realistic by
pointing to an old salt, gray, bent, and knotty-faced.] Yes,
there’s old Timberhead. He and I have weathered many a
storm together. It is only a little farther we have to sail. Look,
look ahead there! It is only to beat just around that point yonder.
Now—now! there is the peaceful, blessful haven and
home full in view.” By this time the audience was weeping,
radiant with hope.</p>

<p>Even his isolated sentences are full of this imaginary realism.
“Sailors ignorant!” he cried indignantly when one depreciated
them; “sailors know everything; they grasp the world in their
hand like an orange!” The boldness of this language is wonderful.
Of superannuated ministers he said: “They are like
camels bearing precious spices and browsing on bitter herbs.
They were moral giants. When God made them he rolled his
sleeves up to the arm-pits.”</p>

<p>It was the activity of his brain, the realism of his imagery
and the homely naturalness of his language that made some of
his transitions abrupt to grotesqueness and some of his speech
border startlingly on impropriety. He really thought aloud—which
many a matter-of-fact, heavy speaker would find it unsafe
to do. Dissociated from their context and from the earnestness
and devout spirit of the man, they sound much worse
than when uttered.</p>

<p>It was the combination of these two qualities also which made
him extravagant in speech, erratic in sentiment, and inconsistent
with himself. He <i>was</i> whatever he thought or imagined for
the moment; his genius possessed and controlled him. Thus
he was a radical temperance reformer, but he denounced prohibitory
legislation and hurled ridicule at those who proposed
the use of an unfermented wine in the sacrament; he called it
“raisin water.” Of rum-sellers he said: “I wonder that the
angels in heaven do not tear up the golden pavements and
throw them on their heads;” but he conjured those who should
succeed him to “Cast out from this church, in my name, any
man that comes up to the altar with his glue-pot and dye-stuff.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jewett says: “I have heard him at times when I have
been amazed at the utter inconsistency of his views, not only
with any standard of doctrine recognized as sound by other
men, but with his own public utterances of perhaps the week
previous. His imagination, once fairly excited, could furnish
in thirty minutes material for half-a-dozen speeches of an hour
each; and, unfortunately, it frequently happened that different
parts of the same speech could be used on opposite sides of the
same question.”</p>

<p>So he denounced the abolitionists and slavery in the same
breath. “Before I would assist one of those Southern devils to
catch a nigger,” he shouted, after reading “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,”
“I would see them all in hell, and I would shout hallelujah on
to the end of it!” “You talk like a rabid abolitionist,” said his
interlocutor. “No,” he cried, with even more vengeance; “no,
I despise them. They have cursed the land!” He called Foster,
the abolitionist orator, “a devil on the platform.” His reverence
for the church led him to consign summarily to a hotter
climate those who came out on the anti-slavery issue; and he
was a vehement advocate of church authority, and evangelical
orthodoxy, yet the most of his life he preached for Unitarians;
and he openly defied the mandate of the conference regarding
Masonry, being a member of the fraternity, and he submitted to
church discipline for his contumacy, but refused to withdraw
from the order, and prayed in public for the anti-Masons,
“O, Lord, make their hearts as soft as their heads are.” Plainly,
there was no managing such a tempestuous soul, and he was
left to go his own way. Honor be to the church that had the
magnanimity and broad charity to let him do his own grand
work in his own grand way. It was herein as grand and eccentric
as an organization as he was among men.</p>

<p>His sarcasm, wit, terseness, and vigor of speech were the
outcome of an energetic and picturesque mind, struggling
with a limited vocabulary for its expression. His sentences were
explosive. “This fast age,” he said, “would be glad to put spurs to
lightning, and blow a trumpet in the ears of thunder.” Again,
“Some people think they are saints. If they could see themselves
as the just in glory see them they wouldn’t dare to look
a decent devil in the face.” “If I owed the devil a hypocrite,
and he wouldn’t take that man for pay, I’d repudiate the debt.”
He called another minister, who had preceded him, and infringed
on his allotted time, “As selfish as a whale who takes in
a ton of herring before breakfast.” Again, “It is a great mistake
to think of converting the world without the help of sailors.
You might as well think of melting a mountain of ice
with a moonbeam, or of heating an oven with snow-balls.” He
called morality, without religion, “Starting a man to heaven
with an icicle in his pocket.” “I am not two inches off heaven!”
he exclaimed, in a moment of religious exaltation. He said to
Channing, the Unitarian: “When you die angels will fight for
the honor of carrying you to heaven on their shoulders.”
“Sailors’ hearts are big as an ox’s; open like a sunflower, and
they carry them in their right hands ready to give them away.”
One of his converts, gifted in prayer, he always called “Salvation-set-to-music.”
A colored brother, speaking with the simple
pathos of his race, drew from Father Taylor the ejaculation,
“There is rain in that cloud.”</p>

<p>But, whether homely or lofty, whether pathetic or witty, he
always talked in dead earnest out of his warm heart, out of his
seething brain, and everything was gilded by the magic touch
of imagination. “A man,” says Stevens, “who could scarcely
speak three sentences, in the pulpit or out of it, without presenting
a striking poetic image, a phrase of rare beauty, or a
sententious sarcasm, whose discourses presented the strangest,
the most brilliant exhibition of sense, epigrammatic thought,
pathos, and humor, spangled over by an exhaustless variety of
the finest images and pervaded by a spiritual earnestness that
subdued all listeners.” “His splendid thoughts come faster
than he can speak them,” said Harriet Martineau, “and at
times he could be totally overwhelmed by them if a burst of
tears, of which he was wholly unconscious, did not aid in his
relief.” “I have seen a diamond shining,” said Dr. Bartol,
“but he was a diamond on fire.”</p>

<p>3. <i>Sympathy.</i> Here was the secret of his power over men.
His emotional nature constantly overflowed all else. With a
marvelous intuition in reading character, a free-masonry with
all phases of human emotions, a magnetism that put him inside
of every heart, he became the better self, the ideal longing of
each listener. It made no difference how learned or stoical the
man was; Father Taylor got hold of him and stirred his heart
from the bottom. A man of wit said, “I am always afraid when
I am laughing at Father Taylor’s wit, for I know he will make
me cry before he has done with me.” People cry and laugh alternately,
and sometimes both together. Laughter is the best
preparation for tears. “Man, thou pendulum betwixt a smile
and tear.” [Are we not all inconsistent, eccentric, at the bottom
of our natures, <i>i. e.</i>, at our very best?] A New York comedian
came to study the method of one of whose acting he had
heard much report; he was so affected by the unlearned art of
this master of the soul that he fairly blubbered behind his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Dr. Wentworth, of another occasion said: “The immense
audience swayed in the wealth of his eloquence like a forest of
willows. We laughed, we wept, we shouted in turns; and
finally, finding myself getting utterly unmanned, and rapidly
dissolving into tears and brine, I fled the pulpit and hid myself
out of earshot of this extraordinary scene.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Wakely, of New York, describes the effects of a prayer
by Father Taylor, at the New York Conference: “The ministers
wept all over the house like little children. Dr. Capers and
Dr. Pitman were in the pulpit with me. Dr. Capers wept and
trembled exceedingly; and Dr. Pitman laughed and cried alternately—smiles
and tears strangely blended.”</p>

<p>“His pathos is the most awful of his powers,” said Miss Martineau,
terrified at his control over her emotions; “I have seen
a single clause of a short sentence call up an instantaneous
flush on hundreds of hard faces.”</p>

<p>Many would not expose their hearts to hear him a second
time; they could not bear the overmastering power.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartol very finely said: “What was the secret but a sympathy,
raised to the highest power, so as to exceed all that we
conceive under that name, so that <i>he saw out of people as well
as into them!</i> He put on their eyes for his eyeglasses, looking
at the world as they did, and they found and felt him in them at
the core and center.” “He was a master of pathos,” said Dr.
Bellows; “rough sailors and beautiful and cultivated Boston
girls, and men like Webster and Emerson, and shop boys and
Cambridge students, and Jenny Lind and Charles Dickens, and
Harriet Martineau, and everybody of taste or curiosity who visited
Boston were seen weeping together with Father Taylor.
Ah, the human heart, down at the bottom, is one.”</p>

<p>He loved all little children with all his Master’s passion. The
baptism of infants was always a baptism of joy and tears with him.
He would gather one to his breast and kiss and croon over it like
a mother. Taking a beautiful little girl in his arms, he raised her
before the whole audience, and said, with streaming eyes, “Look
at the sweet lamb! Her mother has brought her to Christ’s
fold. A baptism of heaven be on thee, my pretty dove.” All
children recognized him at sight for one of their guild. A ragged
little girl walked into the church at his funeral, laid a buttonhole
bouquet on the coffin, and said timidly and sweetly, “He
was <i>my</i> friend,” and so departed. Once when he had been
called to several children’s funerals in succession, he said
to a friend whom he met in the street, “There is something
wrong somewhere. There are storms brewing when so many
doves are flying aloft.”</p>

<p>At funerals he was a refuge of consolation. He so entered
into the hearts bereaved that he felt their hurt. “Father, look
upon us,” he once implored, with mighty and tender supplication,
“<i>we are a widow!</i>” “It is no wonder to me,” said Harriet
Martineau, “that the widow and orphan are cherished by
those who hear his prayers for them.”</p>

<p>Drunken sailors or abandoned women, none were left out of
reach of his infinite sympathy; and it reached the uttermost
parts of the earth. A sailor boy has died and been buried in
South America, and he prays that the Comforter may be near
the bereaved father “when his aged heart goes forth from his
bosom to flutter around the far southern grave of his boy!”
Is Shakspere more dramatic, Shelly more imaginative, Longfellow
more pathetic than this?</p>

<p>Out of this fathomless love he preached his gospel of happiness
and purity and love; for it was doubtless true, as he declared,
that “he never knew the time when he did not love
God.” Out of it came his sweet charity and tolerance. His
lovers were of all denominations and of none—Catholics, Universalists,
Unitarians—for he was “altogether lovely.” When
one at a camp-meeting excluded from salvation all these sects,
all men who used tobacco and all women who wore jewelry,
Father Taylor broke in indignantly, “If that’s true, Christ’s
mission was a failure. It’s a pity he came.” “How far apart
are heaven and hell?” he was asked. “I tell you,” said he,
“they are so near that myriads of souls to-day don’t know which
they are in.” “Blessed Jesus,” he prayed, “give us common
sense, and let no man put blinkers on us, that we can only see
in a certain direction; for we want to look all around the horizon—yea,
to the highest heavens and to the lowest depths of the
ocean.” “When <i>Bigotry</i> is buried I hope I shall be at the funeral,”
he said. His intimacy with the Unitarians, and his remarkable
tribute to Channing have been cited. Of Emerson he
said: “He has the sweetest soul God ever put into a man. If
the devil gets him he will never know what to do with him.”
A theologian asked him what he was going to do with the Unitarians;
“I don’t know,” he said, confidentially; “if they go to
hell they’ll <i>change the atmosphere</i>.” “Is your son-in-law a
Christian?” asked a solicitous brother. “Not exactly,” replied
Father Taylor, “but he’s a very sweet sinner.”</p>

<p>4. <i>His humor.</i> This kept all cheerful, healthy and bright.
He was a “laughing Christian.” I do not think he ever used
humor merely to make people laugh, but always with an earnest
purpose back of it. He was no joker, and rarely thought
his own keen thrusts subjects for merriment.</p>

<p>Of his manliness, his good sense, his improvidence, his sweet
and beautiful home life, space does not suffice to speak.</p>

<p>If to be an original character among men is to be eccentric,
Father Taylor was indeed odd. “He was in all things himself
and not any one else; in this generation there has been but one
Father Taylor,” said Dr. Waterstone; and Dr. Bartol declared
that, “No American citizen—Webster, Clay, Everett, Lincoln,
Choate—has a reputation more impressive and unique.” No
one understood his singularity better than himself. “I will not
wear a straight-jacket or Chinese shoes,” he declared. Having
been invited to lecture, he said: “I can’t lecture; I would not
lecture if I could. Your lectures are all macadamized; they
are entertainments where those go who dare not visit the theater.
I must cross-plow your fine paths. I am no man’s model,
no man’s copyist, no man’s agent; go on my own hook; say
what I please, and you may help yourselves.”</p>

<p>Like all greatly-eccentric souls, I presume, he felt his own
isolation and want of comprehension of himself by others. One
who sat far into the night in communion of soul with him, said:
“You are a strange mortal!” “Well,” said he, pathetically, “I
have made up my mind there never was but one E. T. Taylor
and, so far as I have anything to do with it, there never shall
be another.”</p>

<p>When we think of his birth, training, and surroundings—the
child of the plantation and the graduate of the forecastle—and
contrast this with his peculiar powers, his strange career, and
above all in rarity his wonderful world-wide mission, it is not
too much to say that Father Taylor is without a parallel in
American history. “An impulsive, untrained, and erratic genius;”
there was a fixed purpose and a continuity of effort,
such as is seen in few lives. If extravagant in speech and inconsistent
in views, his intensity, vividness, and realism, make
all sound like plain common-sense. Haughty and tender, imperious
and democratic, grand and simple, splendidly uncultured;
a strange, terrible power among men always used for
leading, driving, persuading to righteousness. He deserves a
paraphrase of a higher tribute than Phillips, the Irish barrister,
gave to Napoleon. Such a medley of contradictions and at the
same time such individual consistency for right were never before
united in the same character. In the solitude of his originality,
he was always the same mysterious, incomprehensible
self—a man without a model and without a shadow.</p>

<p>“When I am dead,” he pleaded, “I do not want to be buried
in dirt. But bury me rather in the deep salt sea, where the
coral rocks shall be my pillow, and the seaweeds shall be my
winding-sheet, and the waves shall sing my requiem forever.”</p>

<p>And it was not done. Conventionality triumphed in death
over the old eccentric, who had defied it as long as he lived.</p>

<p>May the new year work be promptly begun, faithfully prosecuted,
satisfactorily completed!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>October 1 is Memorial Day—the day of the beginning of our
college year. The bell at Chautauqua will ring at high noon.
Listen for its echoes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One member has already nearly finished two of the books
since the meetings closed at Chautauqua. He read on the train;
he read at the station; he read at the hotel; he read during the
odd minutes at home. This is a good example.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The readings for October are: History of Greece,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> vol. 2, by
Prof. T. T. Timayenis, parts 7 and 8; Chautauqua Text-Books—No.
5, Greek History, by Dr. J. H. Vincent; Primer of American
Literature, by C. F. Richardson; required readings in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Let the members of the Class of ’83 who were not graduated
in August, now begin to read up the required books, and be
ready for graduation in 1884.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the earliest announcement of the course of study for 1883-84,
the little Chautauqua Text-Book No. 22, on Biology, was
given. Many members suppose that this is the substitute for
“Easy Lessons in Vegetable Biology,” an altogether different
book. The price of Chautauqua Text-Book No. 22 is 10 cents;
the price of “Easy Lessons in Vegetable Biology” is (in the
cheapest edition) 25 cents. If they will return to Phillips &amp;
Hunt, 805 Broadway, New York, the Chautauqua Text-Book
and 15 cents additional, they will forward the “Easy Lessons in
Vegetable Biology.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Students in the Class of 1887 should have Chautauqua Text-Books
Nos. 4 and 5, English and Greek History. They have
already been read by the other classes. Price, 10 cents each.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. are earnestly urged to read Chautauqua
Text-Book No. 24, Canadian History. This should have
been required in the earlier lists.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>All members of the C. L. S. C. should examine carefully the
“Popular Education” circular which appears in this number of
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, to ascertain if they have the complete
list of books for the year.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the payment of one dollar, all graduates of the C. L. S. C.
will be entitled to all communications from the central office for
four years, the four white crystal seals, and any additional white
seals which they may gain. The one dollar does not, of course,
pay for special seals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Chautauqua Hand-Book No. 2—known as the “Green
Book”—which contains a full account of the C. L. S. C. work,
is now ready. Send a two cent stamp to Miss K. F. Kimball,
Plainfield, N. J., and you will receive a copy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Class of 1884 should send in their back reports as soon
as possible. It is so much better to get all ready in advance,
and not wait until the close of the year, when the general office
is crowded, the secretaries busy, and mistakes easily possible.</p>

<p>The full accounts of the C. L. S. C. commencement exercises
at the summer Assemblies, which we publish this month, take
the place of the reports from the local circles. It is only for this
month, however. The department will continue to be a regular
feature of the magazine. These reports have been of great
service to local circles everywhere, and we earnestly request
that full and exact accounts of work should be forwarded us by
the president or secretary of each local circle. Let any new
feature in the program be fully described; give us all the new
plans for social work, give everything that will be suggestive
and helpful. Several times last year we were asked how to
work up a new circle, or to revive a dying one. Where leaders
have had experience in building up these circles let them give
testimony through the “Local Circle” column. It may help
others in similar circumstances. The new and helpful features
are what we want for this department. If the members will co-operate,
the local circle reports will be very useful.</p>

<h3>1.—AIM.</h3>

<p>This new organization aims to promote habits of reading and study in nature, art,
science, and in secular and sacred literature, in connection with the routine of daily
life (especially among those whose educational advantages have been limited), so as
to secure to them the college student’s general outlook upon the world and life, and to
develop the habit of close, connected, persistent thinking.</p>


<h3>2.—METHODS.</h3>

<p>It proposes to encourage individual study in lines and by text-books which shall be
indicated; by local circles for mutual help and encouragement in such studies; by
summer courses of lectures and “students’ sessions” at Chautauqua, and by written
reports and examinations.</p>


<h3>3.—COURSE OF STUDY.</h3>

<p>The course of study prescribed by the C. L. S. C. shall cover a period of four years.</p>


<h3>4.—ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES.</h3>

<p><i>Each year’s Course of Study will be considered the “First Year” for new pupils</i>
whether it be the first, second, third, or fourth of the four years’ course. For example,
“the class of 1887,” instead of beginning October, 1883, with the same studies
which were pursued in 1882-83 by “the class of 1886,” will fall in with “the class of
’86,” and take for their first year the second year’s course of the ’86 class. The first
year for “the class of 1886” will thus in due time become the fourth year for “the
class of 1887.”</p>

White Crystal Seal Course is prepared. This consists mainly of books belonging to
the current year’s study, but not previously read by the graduates. An additional
white seal is also offered to the graduates, the books for which are specified under

<h4>6.—SPECIAL COURSES.</h4>

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. may take, in addition to the regular course above prescribed,
one or more special courses, and pass an examination upon them. Pupils
will receive credit and testimonial seals to be appended to the regular diploma, according
to the merit of examinations on these supplemental courses.</p>


<h4>7.—THE PREPARATORY COURSE.</h4>

<p>Persons who are too young, or not sufficiently advanced in their studies to take the
regular C. L. S. C. course, may adopt certain <i>preparatory lessons</i> for one or more
years.</p>

<p>For circulars of the preparatory course, address Miss <span class="smcap">K. F. Kimball</span>, Plainfield,
New Jersey.</p>


<h4>8.—INITIATION FEE.</h4>

<p>To defray the expenses of correspondence, memoranda, etc., an annual fee of fifty
cents is required. This amount should be forwarded to Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield,
N. J., (by New York or Philadelphia draft, Post-office order on Plainfield, N.
J., or the new Postal Note, to be ready about September 1.) Do not send postage-stamps
if you can possibly avoid it. <i>Three</i>-cent stamps will not be received.</p>

<p>N. B.—In sending your fee, be sure to state to which class you belong, whether
1884, 1885, 1886, or 1887.</p>


<h4>9.—APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP.</h4>

<p>Persons desiring to unite with the C. L. S. C. should forward answers to the following
questions to <span class="smcap">Miss</span> K. F. KIMBALL, <span class="smcap">Plainfield</span>, N. J. The class graduating
in 1887 should begin the study of the lessons required October, 1883. They <i>may</i> begin
as late as January 1, 1884.</p>

<p>1. Give your name in full.</p>

<p>2. Your post-office address, with county and State.</p>

<p>3. Are you married or single?</p>

<p>4. What is your age? Are you between twenty and thirty, or thirty and forty, or
forty and fifty, or fifty and sixty, etc.?</p>

<p>5. If married, how many children living under the age of sixteen years?<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

SUPREMACY, AND MACEDONIAN HELLENISM.</h3>

<p>1. Q. What was the character of the Thebans in the fifth and
fourth centuries before Christ? A. They were brave soldiers,
and possessed souls, if not always noble, yet ever resolute;
bodies, if not prepossessing, yet athletic and well prepared, by
exercise and thorough drill from early childhood, for every military
duty.</p>

<p>2. Q. What two names are permanently associated with the
rise of Theban power? A. Epaminondas and Pelopidas.</p>

<p>3. Q. What was the training and what some of the striking
characteristics of Epaminondas? A. He was trained from early
youth in all the branches of gymnastics and military duty; was
distinguished by the diligent care he took of his intellectual education;
was modest and wholly devoid of a boasting spirit, and
was indifferent to money.</p>

<p>4. Q. What did Epaminondas, with Pelopidas, organize that
filled Hellas with the fame of its achievements, and fell only
when the autonomy of Hellas disappeared? A. The famous
lochos, or band, composed of three hundred picked men, bound
together by the closest ties of friendship, and devoted to each
other to the death.</p>

<p>5. Q. What was the effect upon the Spartans of the war
against the Thebans, the latter being assisted by the Athenians,
during the first part of the fourth century before Christ? A.
The Spartans were daily losing their prestige and becoming
humbled.</p>

<p>6. Q. What was the most noted of the combats of the Thebans
with the Lacedæmonians in Bœotia at this time, which served as
a sort of prelude to that of Leuktra? A. The battle of Tegyra,
in which the Thebans, led by Pelopidas, achieved a splendid
victory.</p>

<p>7. Q. What disastrous visitations heightened the despondency
of the Spartans in 372 B. C.? A. The terrible earthquakes and
rains which during that year occurred in the Peloponnesus, and
which they regarded as tokens of the wrath of the god Poseidon.</p>

<p>8. Q. What was the result of the Athenians having established
their new naval dominion on the Ionian Sea? A. They
had no longer ground on which to continue the war, and they
therefore sent to Sparta for peace.</p>

<p>9. Q. What was the result of the congress of the Hellenic nation

and concentrated a superior number upon the right wing.</p>

<p>13. Q. What is said of the adoption of this arrangement of
the forces of an army afterward by military leaders? A. It
was afterward largely adopted by military leaders, and by its
successful application some of the greatest battles of the world
have been gained by such generals as Frederick of Prussia and
Napoleon.</p>

<p>14. Q. What was the result at the battle of Leuktra? A. The

<p>78. Q. What was the effect of the reception of the news of
the death of Philip at Athens and elsewhere? A. There was

<h2><a name="EDITORS_OUTLOOK" id="EDITORS_OUTLOOK">EDITOR’S OUTLOOK.</a></h2>


<h3>THE TENTH ASSEMBLY.</h3>

<p>Ten years ago the First Assembly offered to the world the
Chautauqua Idea. It promised an almost ideal summer life,
where health and thought and brotherly love should abound.
Ten years have passed, and now the question is, has the scheme
been carried out? Is the Assembly a practical idea, and is it a
permanency? The answers are most decided. The original
plan has not only been put into practice, but, when enlarged an
hundred fold, has been proven practicable. Is it a permanency
may be a harder question, but the tenth Assembly has, we believe,
in many ways proven it so. First, the character and
growth of all departments of Chautauqua work show them to
be needed institutions, and necessary institutions, as a rule,
become permanent. The steady, healthy growth of the different
branches of work shows how enduring is the Idea; the
Normal department increased its alumni this year to over 1,200;
its plans for future work are much more elaborate than ever
before, its course of study much superior. The annual report
from the School of Languages shows a steady increase. Over
two hundred full tickets were sold in the school this year, and
twenty-six different states were represented.</p>

<p>The Teachers’ Retreat for 1883 shows a great increase over
previous years:</p>

<p>In 1879 there were enrolled 15 members.</p>

<p>In 1880 there were enrolled 133 members.</p>

<p>In 1881 there were enrolled 105 members.</p>

<p>In 1882 there were enrolled 76 members.</p>

<p>In 1883 there were enrolled 223 members.</p>

<p>The C. L. S. C. has reached the enormous membership of
nearly 50,000. Besides the advance in the different schools, the
attendance at the Assembly was unprecedented. In the earlier
years of an institution this might mean very little—a boom, and
nothing more—but in the tenth year, when the place has become
well-known, it does mean a great deal. These people,
too, were not all new friends. Chautauqua has been able to
keep its old friends, while every season it has added hosts of
new ones. The whole exterior showed it. When streets are
lighted by the electric light, and houses are built on stone foundations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lathed and plastered, and furnished with modern improvements,
a town has reached a period of durability. Things
are built to stay. Chautauqua puts up no more shanties. It has
become a city, not of a day but for all time.</p>

<p>The genuine hearty enthusiasm which animates the workers
and friends of the movement is, to us, a most excellent reason
for believing the institution lasting. There is a feeling among
many that enthusiasm is a weakness, a quality not exactly in
good form, not in keeping with cultured minds. This is a mistake.
Enthusiasm, combined with good sense and industry, is
the best equipment for any enterprise. As Emerson says, “A
man is at his best when enthusiastic,” and we believe Chautauqua
is most successful when most enthusiastic—most sure of
permanence because capable of always inspiring others with
enduring enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The great Assembly opens its doors to every one, but few
realize the real value of the idea, or appreciate the conditions
of society which make feasible such an idea. Said an eminent
German, after having studied the Assembly thoroughly: “You
Americans do not appreciate this wonderful plant of yours. In
my country we could not have a Chautauqua; no other country
under the sun could support such an institution. It is peculiarly
American.” We do not appreciate the Idea. It is too ideal for
the practical minds of the day. But though we may not grasp
its full meaning, the Tenth Assembly has proven that people are
beginning to understand the practicability, the breadth, and the
permanence of the Chautauqua Idea.</p>

<h3>THE C. L. S. C. AN EDUCATIONAL NECESSITY OF
THE TIMES.</h3>

<p>Necessity is a word which in its use depends on circumstances.
What is necessary to a people in one age may not have
been to their ancestors a generation earlier. Time was when
the masses of men were not required to act with intelligence of
their own, but to follow the decree of the privileged few or obey
the behest of the autocratic individual. Illustrations of such a
state of society remain. They are to be found wherever the
autocracy or oligarchy, whether political or ecclesiastical, continues
its sway.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it is easily seen that the only education
required is obedience, blind and unquestioning. All that goes
beyond this only makes the individual unhappy and embarrasses
authority. Hence, since her ambition has been absolute
power, the wisdom of that favorite motto of the Romish church,
“keep the people in ignorance,” a motto which she has done
her best to put in practice.</p>

<p>But our age and civilization have fallen upon other conditions.
Obedience is still required, and indeed ever must be,
but it is no longer with eyes tight shut, but open; and we are
not only encouraged, but by the very conditions of society, are
required to ask questions concerning the very grounds of obedience.
Something has taken the place of infallible Church and
infallible State. That something is enlightened conscience and
educated judgment.</p>

<p>In this country the corner-stone of whose stability and permanence
must rest on obedience born of intellectual and moral
enlightenment, some things have become, and daily are becoming
more and more apparent. It is apparent that universal
education of a certain kind, a kind that includes to no small
degree both head and heart, must go with universal suffrage.
It is neither treason nor heresy to say that in the light of experience
and of the signs of the times, neither our common
schools on the one hand, nor our academies, colleges and universities
on the other, are competent to meet and provide for
all the educational needs of the American people. Too much
can not be said in praise of these institutions. They have been
the conservators of our national ideas in the past. But we are
growing, and citizenship means higher responsibilities and
higher obligations than aforetime. The common school which
fits a man for the transactions of ordinary business and prepares
the foundation for a higher development, does a great
work; but the man who settles down to life without further inspiration
and opportunity can hardly be fitted for the higher
work and duties of the home and society. Whence then comes, or
can come, this inspiration and better preparation? Thus far in
our history it has come through the seminary and college. But it
is evident that not more than one in twenty of the American
youth can have these higher advantages. Reduce the expense
to the minimum and there are still insurmountable barriers in
the way. It needs no argument, therefore, to show that an organization
with the plans, aims and methods of the <i>Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle</i> has a mission which bears
the sanction of necessity. The wide gap between the common
school and the college must be filled, and only can be filled by
that which brings the means of education to the home; to the
youth learning his trade, to the man or woman in the midst of
daily duties and employments. The demand is for that which
will fill the atmosphere about life with aspiration and the spirit
of inquiry. It is for that which will furnish suggestions, a plan
and a guide to lead the inquiring mind. Precisely this is the
C. L. S. C. Here is its mission and here its <i>necessity</i>—and the
necessity likewise of all kindred similar organizations which are
yet to spring up and follow in her course.</p>

<h3>THE SHAKSPERE CONTROVERSY.</h3>

<p>It is strange how sometimes an opinion altogether untenable,
which some one has broached, is taken up by others, and comes
in time to be accepted as true by a considerable number. It
was some twenty-five years ago that a Miss Delia Bacon published
an elaborate argument whose end was to show that not
William Shakspere, but Lord Francis Bacon, was the author of
the immortal plays which bear the former’s name. She first
gave her discovery—unquestionably of the highest importance,
if correct—to the world in a magazine article; but afterward
embodied it in quite a large volume, to which Nathaniel Hawthorne
wrote an introduction, though he did not accept the
writer’s theory. This was the beginning of a controversy which
is still alive. Perhaps the number has never been very large
of those who believe that the glory of Shakspere belongs to Bacon;
but there have always been some to entertain the preposterous
notion, from Miss Bacon to Mrs. Henry Pott.</p>

<p>The latter lady has recently issued a book which has excited
some interest. The title—somewhat drawn out—is, “The Promus
of Formularies and Elegancies (being private notes, <i>circa</i>
1594, hitherto unpublished) of Francis Bacon, illustrated and
elucidated by passages from Shakspere.” Mrs. Pott’s undertaking
is one more in the line of Miss Delia Bacon. By a comparison
of the Bacon notes, in forms of expression and thought,
with passages of the Shakspere tragedies and comedies, she endeavors
to verify the theory that the great English philosopher—author
of the “Novum Organum,” and characterized by Pope
as “the greatest, wisest, and meanest of mankind”—is also author
of the works accorded to the Bard of Avon. That she
succeeds in her task she herself evidently entertains no doubt,
but probably not many will agree with her. She finds correspondences
and similarities in passages compared where her
readers will try in vain to find them; and it is putting the matter
mildly to say that her undertaking is a great failure.</p>

<p>Considerable ingenuity and much enthusiasm have been
shown by advocates of the theory which makes Lord Bacon
the author of the works of Shakspere; but the theory is an absurd
one, with nothing whatever to support it. The internal
evidence, contained in the works of the two authors, not only
gives the theory no support, but is alone enough to a sane mind
completely to demolish it. The whole cast of Bacon’s mind, as
shown by his known writings, was as unlike as it could be to
that of the person who wrote the Shakspere dramas and sonnets.
And what other evidence is adduced by those who would
have us transfer to another the laurels of the man who was easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the greatest mind in all literature? None whatever. The
truth is, it is the improbability from the nature of the case—or,
as some would say, the impossibility—that such a person as
William Shakspere, the son of a Stratford yeoman, with limited
educational opportunities, whose youth was by no means promising,
should have produced the works to which for two centuries
his name has been attached, which is at the bottom of the
theory which gives the authorship to another. This, and nothing
else, originated the idea, and keeps it alive. We are told
that to believe in Shakspere as the author of these works, universally
acknowledged as unapproached and unapproachable,
is to believe a miracle. “Whence hath this man this wisdom?”
it is asked, as was asked of the Divine Man; and we are reminded
that the stream never rises higher than the fountain.
Shakspere could not have produced the works—the power was
not in him, it is reasoned, but the wise Bacon might have done
it; therefore people search for the wherewithal to substantiate
an assumption giving the authorship to the latter. But we must
believe the miracle; there is no escape. Did Milton write the
“Paradise Lost,” and Lord Bacon the “Novum Organum?” Is
the Iliad the work of Homer? It is just as certain that the
Shakspere writings were the offspring of Shakspere’s genius.
We admit the marvel, but there is no setting aside of the fact.
And when we are asked to explain how this man could have
acquired the power to produce these prodigies of human genius,
we can only say, the Maker gave it to him.</p>

<p>The C. L. S. C. received special attention at the summer Assemblies.
By referring to the reports published elsewhere in this
number, our readers will learn how the Chautauqua spirit
spreads, and how the organization is being strengthened in all
parts of the land.</p>

<p>Recent Presidents of the United States have shown their taste
for recreation very positively. Ex-President Grant was fond of
good horses and rapid driving; ex-President Hayes visited colleges
during the commencement season, and loved his farm as
a quiet retreat; President Arthur turns from his arduous labors
to the rod and line and long journeys, such as he has made to
Florida and the West during the past year.</p>

<p>Prophecies are numerous from newspaper men as to who
will be the candidates for the presidency in 1884. Ex-Secretary
Blaine is reported as having turned his attention to
literature, and announces that he is not a candidate; Mr. Tilden
has retired to the privacy of Gramercy Park; ex-Secretary
Windom, it is said by the wise ones, went out of the succession
when he failed of a re-election to the Senate. Reports are rife
in influential political circles that the Secretary of War is likely
to be one of his martyred fathers’ successors, but time alone
will show us the true successor.</p>

<p>Mr. A. M. Sullivan, in a recent number of the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, discusses “Irish Emigration as a remedy for Irish
trouble in Ireland.” He says: “Of the group of dynamite
conspirators who stood in the dock at Newgate the other day—men
whose frightful purpose was to bury London in ruins—not
one was born on Irish soil. All were the sons or grandsons of
men swept away from ‘congested districts,’ and sent or driven
to America ‘for the good of those who went, and of those who
were left behind.’ Whoever has recently traveled in America
must have been struck with the fact that animosity toward
England often displays itself more strongly in the second and
third generations of Irish Americans than in the men who were
actually driven forth.”</p>

<p>The present administration is not all-powerful in a certain
kind of its political movements. The Secretary of the Treasury,
Mr. Folger, was defeated for Governor of New York in the
election last fall, and recently Mr. Chandler, Secretary of the
Navy, failed of an election to the United States Senate in the
New Hampshire Legislature.</p>

<p>Chautauqua grows in favor with the public. The Ohio State
Teacher’s Association held their annual convention there in
July last, and with social gatherings, lectures, and discussions
on live questions, in the educational world, they made it an
interesting and profitable session. The Pennsylvania State
Teacher’s Association will hold their convocation at Chautauqua
Lake for 1884. It is an endorsement of Chautauqua when large
bodies of educators go from their own States into another to
hold their most important gatherings. The National Teacher’s
Association met at this center once, and the Ohio people have
been there twice. It is this sort of gatherings that the Chautauqua
authorities are especially pleased to welcome to the parks,
public buildings, and all the privileges of the classic groves.</p>

<p>The Royal Humane Society, in its recently issued report, gives
the following advice to swimmers and bathers: “Avoid bathing
within two hours after a meal. Avoid bathing when exhausted
by fatigue, or from any other cause. Avoid bathing when the
body is cooling after perspiration. Avoid bathing altogether in
the open air if, after having been a short time in the water, it
causes a sense of chilliness with numbness of the hands and
feet. Bathe when the body is warm, provided no time is lost in
getting into the water. Avoid chilling the body by sitting or
standing undressed on the banks or in boats after having been
in the water. Avoid remaining too long in the water; leave the
water immediately if there is the slightest feeling of chilliness.”</p>

<p>The West promises to set a good example to the East in more
than one question of morals. The case deserving of mention
now is where Governor Crittenden, of Missouri, and Governor
Glick, of Kansas, and their Attorney-Generals, notified the two
prize-fighters, Slade and Mitchell, that even training for a prize-fight
would send them to the State prison. This so alarmed
them that they quit the United States and went to Mexico. The
laws of the older States are as severe on this brutal practice as
those of Missouri and Kansas, but the laxity in the enforcement
of the laws is the only license that prize-fighters find to justify
their training in New York, Boston, and other old cities. Some
of our authorities could profitably “go West” to study how to
enforce civil law.</p>

<p>Dr. John Roche, an English physician who has had remarkable
experiences, gives as his conclusion that cholera is purely
and simply a specific fever, only inferior in its ravages to yellow
fever, and closely allied to it. Cholera has a period of incubation
varying from two to fourteen days; prone to attack the
enervated and those subject to depression from any cause. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is contagious, and liable to occur periodically about every ten
years in some parts of India. It seems to have visited the British
Isles about every sixteen years, and as the period has elapsed
since the last outbreak, it is more than likely to occur this year.
Those persons who indulge in no enervating habits, and take
nothing internally which would arrest the secretions nor too
drastically stimulate them, and partake of nothing which is
highly fermentable, may safely feel that they are cholera-proof
during an epidemic.</p>

<p>“The Old South Lectures for Young People” is a pleasing
and successful plan for teaching the History of America. Lectures
are held Wednesday afternoon at the “Old South Meeting
House,” Boston, and the subjects illustrate well the tenor of the
meeting. Thus for September the topics are “Franklin,” “How
to Study American History,” “The Year 1777,” “History in the
Boston Streets.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the ninth day of September, the steamship “Nevada”
landed 682 Mormons at New York, being the fourth
company that has been brought over this year. H. H. Evans,
the secretary, said that there were in the company 269 British,
106 Swiss and Germans, 284 Scandinavians, and 23 returning
missionaries. “Every emigrant,” he added, “paid his or her
passage over. No aid is afforded them by the Mormon Church.
The majority have a little money with them, enough to establish
themselves in America. They will locate in sixteen towns
in Utah. All we do is to protect them while traveling from
Liverpool to Utah. Some of these immigrants have been years
laying up money to pay their passage to this country.” One of
the Mormon immigrants did not go through to Utah. Her
name is Regina Andersen. She is a Swedish woman, spinster,
thirty-five years of age, and is afflicted with blindness. Her
brother Leander and her sister Anna, who live in Philadelphia,
had heard of her intention to go to Utah and were at Castle
Garden to intercept her before the “Nevada” arrived. They
insisted upon talking with their blind sister, and soon succeeded
in persuading her to abandon the Mormon proselytes and prepare
to go with her relatives to Philadelphia. The Mormon
missionaries were strongly opposed to the woman leaving the
party, but the matter was brought before Superintendent Jackson,
and the woman was permitted to go to Philadelphia with
her brother. She had prepaid her passage to Salt Lake and
did not receive her money back. In conversation with a reporter
the woman appeared not to know anything about the peculiar
institution of the Mormon Church—polygamy. Congress
could quite as consistently, and with better results to the country,
enact a law to prevent this kind of emigration, than the
one they have leveled against the Chinese. Why not meet
Mormonism at New York harbor and prevent this infamous
traffic in human lives?</p>

<p>The Rev. Henry A. Powell, in his Congregational church in
Williamsburg, on a Sunday in September discussed “The sorrows
of the Free Thinkers as revealed at their recent convention,”
from this suggestive text: “The show of their countenances
doth witness against them.” He stated that over their
platform were hung the pictures of Thomas Paine, R. G. Ingersoll,
and D. M. Bennett—Paine author of a book against
the Bible—Ingersoll, dispenser of blasphemy—Bennett, who not
long since served a term in the penitentiary for sending foul
literature through the mails. “How much better than such
visionary wanderings is the old story of a living Father in
heaven, of a Savior who suffered on the cross, and angel visitants
to lead us from the life mortal to the life immortal.”</p>

<p>We call the attention of our readers to the notice elsewhere
in this number of the “Chautauqua School of Languages,” the
different departments of which are to be organized into schools
of correspondence, so that students may, at their homes, study
Hebrew, German, French, etc., by corresponding with competent
teachers. This is a rare opportunity for members of the C.
L. S. C., or any others who desire, to study the languages, but
are denied the privileges of the schools. Next month we shall
introduce the “Normal Work” into <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, in a few
initial chapters, from the pens of Rev. Dr. Hurlbut and Prof.
R. S. Holmes, and thus extend to our readers through the year
the privilege of pursuing this course, which is a main feature of
the summer assemblies.</p>

<p>The telegraph operators have by their strike provoked a general
discussion in the press of the telegraph system of the
country, besides exciting the attention of Postmaster-General
Gresham, who promises to discuss in his annual report to Congress
the practicability of the general government assuming
control of all telegraph lines as it does of the postal service.
It ought to work as well in the United States as it does in England.
Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster-General of Great Britain, reports
that “the number of telegraph messages sent in the United
Kingdom during the last year was 32,092,026.” Mr. Fawcett says
that it has been decided that as soon as the necessary increase
of plant can be made, the minimum charge for inland telegrams
will be reduced from 24 to 12 cents.</p>

<p>A correspondent says, under date of September 9: “The last
spike on the Northern Pacific Road was driven this afternoon
on the Pacific slope of the Rocky Mountains, 2,500 miles from
the Atlantic Ocean, and 800 miles from the Pacific, and 91 years
after the idea of a highway from the Lakes to the Pacific was
first suggested by Thomas Jefferson.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Analogous to the Normal Class Bible work of the Chautauqua
University is a new movement in Russia. An organization
called the <i>Stundists</i> bind themselves to devote an hour (<i>stunde</i>)
every day to the study of the Bible. The society has grown to
immense proportions, and is said to have reclaimed whole villages
from drunkenness and crime.</p>

<p>Keshub Chunder Sen, the famous leader of the Brahmo
Somaj, is about to visit Europe and America again, to preach
a new development of faith, in which Hinduism and Christianity
are to be combined. Little good, we fear, will result from
the Baboo’s advocacy of an eclectic system; for his adherents
will be content to stop in that dim twilight instead of advancing
into the full glory of the divine day. The teaching of the
leader himself seems latterly to have degenerated into ceremonialism,
and he attributes marvelous influence to external
things; while some of his followers are giving themselves up
with the wildest enthusiasm to perfect a sacred dance of a complex
kind, organized with rotating rings of participants dressed
in garbs of varied hue. All this mummery is a sad disappointment
for those who hoped that Chunder Sen might destroy
heathenism besides purifying it.</p>

<p>The Louisville <i>Courier</i> of August 9, referring to the great Exposition,
speaks thus of one of the exhibitions: “Last night
the electric railway was in operation, and the locomotive with
two cars attached made the tour of the park. To-day it will be
running constantly, and visitors will see what is the latest
achievement of science. It is an event of extraordinary interest.
It is the practical demonstration of the power of electricity
applied as a motor. Without fire or smoke, with no visible
agent to propel it, moved by an unseen and even as yet an almost
unknown influence, it follows the path marked out with
all the celerity and certainty demanded by the most cautious
and practical.”</p>

<p>The directors of the Western Union Telegraph Company have
made a concession to their employes by issuing the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
order: “Commencing to-day (September 1), seven and a half
hours actual service in this office during week nights will constitute
a day’s work, or, in other words, the hours of the night
force will be from 5:30 p. m. till 1:30 a. m., allowing thirty minutes
for lunch. Sunday service will be paid for the same as
other over-time services, at the rate of one-seventh of a day’s
pay for each hour. All payments for over-time, including Sunday
service, or for a fractional part of a month, will be based
upon the number of week days in the month.”</p>

<p>Professor Bell is reported as saying in a recent conversation
that there are more than 500,000 telephones in use in the United
States, and the manufacturers are unable to supply the demand
so as to keep abreast of orders. He said that the progress of
the telephone would have been greater but for the opposition of
the telegraph companies, who regarded it as, in part, a competitor
instead of an ally. In other countries the telegraph companies
had very generally adopted the telephone as an auxiliary,
especially at city branch offices and at small offices in the
country.</p>

<p>Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, of England, is in this country,
a guest of the American bar. English judges may be aristocrats,
but they are generally above corruption. It is to be hoped
that American ideas of judicial dignity and honor will be raised
by what they may observe in this chief of the English bench.</p>

<p>Not a few Americans were astonished at the display of local
manufactures which Ireland exhibited in the Boston “Foreign
Art and Industrial Exhibition.” Among the objects were bog-wood
ornaments, hair ornaments, furniture, marbles, sculpture,
etc. The variety of work suggests that in the not distant future
the distressed country will have manufactures and arts to employ
its people. Its resources are particularly fitted to certain
arts. Thus few countries boast so great a variety of marbles; its
clay is particularly suitable for modeling: osiers grow readily on
its soil, and the natural woods are incomparably fine. With
these industries developed, and a system of railroads through
the country, much would be done toward settling the Irish
question.</p>

<p>When a woman marries, and learns that in the race of life
she is better qualified to earn the family living than her husband,
it will be helpful to have a precedent at hand by which to govern
her husband. Here is one, taken from the communication
of a successful working woman to a Boston exchange. She
says: “I am a milliner, and have made between $1,500 and $2,500
a year in my business for some time past. I married four years
ago. My husband is kind and good looking, but he never
learned any trade, had no profession and could not average
$500 a year. I loved him, however, but I saw that it would not
do to depend upon him, so I kept on with my business. After
a time I think he got a little lazy, and as we were both away
during the day, we could not keep house and got sick of boarding.
Finally I proposed that he should keep house and I would
run the business and find the money. We have now lived very
happily in this way for two years. My husband rises and builds
the fire, gets breakfast, and I leave at 7:45 for my place of
business. He does the washing, ironing, and cleaning, and I
do not know of any woman who can beat him. He is as neat
as wax, and can cook equal to any one in town. It may be an
isolated case, but I think the time has now come when women
who have husbands to support should make them do the work;
otherwise they are luxuries we must do without.”</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE">EDITOR’S TABLE.</a></h2>


<p class="question">Q. What is the meaning of boycotting?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Boycott was the name of an Irish landlord whose tenants
refused to gather his crops, and endeavored to prevent his doing
it. To withhold help and patronage, or in any way to obstruct
or hinder the business of another—a meanness that is
despicable—is to treat him as the tenants treated Mr. Boycott.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Was General Grant the author of the expression, “We
have met the enemy and they are ours?”</p>

<p class="answer">A. The above is very like to Cæsar’s “<i>veni, vidi, vici</i>,” and
as a general’s report of a great victory just won, is remarkable
for its comprehensive brevity. The words, though in harmony
with the character and sayings of General Grant, were not, if
used, original with him, but should be credited to Commodore
Perry.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Why was the son of Edward III. called the Black Prince?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Because of his black armor.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Was Alexander of Macedon, who informed the Greeks before
the battle of Platea of the intended attack, their ally?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Not openly; but secretly he was, or the information would
not have been given.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Where is the mountain lake Shawangunk?</p>

<p class="answer">A. The Shawangunk (Shon-gum) mountain is properly a continuation
of the Appalachian, or Allegheny chain in New York.
Like the Adirondacks and Catskills, south of the Mohawk, also
outliers of the chain, it seems separated by intervening lands
of lower elevation, and the relationship is shown by similarity
of the geological formation. Look for the lake in the same
region. It is probably small, and may not be found on most
maps.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Was it not Leonidas who, before the battle of Thermopylæ,
said, “The Persians are so numerous that their arrows will
darken the sun?”</p>

<p class="answer">A. No. Those words may intimate fear of the overwhelming
force of the enemy, and the Greek historian does not mention
their author, but says that on hearing them, a brave Spartan replied:
“All the better, as we will then fight in the shade.”</p>

<p class="question">Q. Which construction? “Thus were music and poetry
born in the same family, and we shall notice how that they have
clung to each other,” or “how they have clung?”</p>

<p class="answer">A. The latter is preferred. The conjunctive particle is not
needed, and though occasionally thus used by a good writer,
only encumbers the sentence.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Who was Caius Cestius?</p>

<p class="answer">A. A wealthy Roman citizen of the Augustan age, a client of
Cicero, of not much distinction, though rich. A part of his
estate was employed in building for him a fine mausoleum,
which remains to the present day, though most of the contemporaneous
surrounding structures have long been in ruins.
Near it lie the ashes of Keats and Shelly. After the death of
Keats, Shelly wrote of his friend: “He lies in the lovely, romantic
cemetery of the Protestants of Rome, near the tomb of
Caius Cestius, and within the mossy walls and towns, now
mouldering and desolate, which formed the circuit of ancient
Rome. The cemetery is an open space among the ruins, covered
in winter with violets and daisies. It might make one in
love with death to think of being buried in so sweet a place.”</p>

<p class="question">Q. Can you give the date of Mrs. Browning’s birth in 1809?</p>

<p class="answer">A. We can not. No records now at hand give the day or
month. It is not best to be greatly troubled over our want of
information on the subject, as it is quite safe to conclude she
was “well born” some time during the year mentioned. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
other eminent writers have gone into history with the same uncertainty
as to the day of their birth.</p>

<p class="question">Q. In whose hands was the government of the United States
from 1783 to 1789?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Nominally in the Continental Congress—a kind of quasi
central government. Practically in the hands of the colonists
and their legislators. The war was ended and the United States
acknowledged a free, sovereign, and independent nation. But
they were, as yet, united only by the “articles of confederation”
adopted in 1778; a bond of union that was soon found inadequate
to secure a strong, permanent government amidst the
perils that threatened the new republic. The regulation of commerce,
the adjustment of difficulties between States, and the
public defense were not sufficiently provided for. Congress
could devise and recommend measures, but had little power to
legislate, even on subjects that concerned the whole. There
was still more need of an efficient executive department.
Feeling that the articles of confederation were, in the changed
state of the country, no longer sufficient, the leading statesmen
wisely framed, and the country adopted the American Constitution,
giving us a strong central government, with the least possible
surrender of rights by the States thus united.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Was there any reason for calling Alexander the Great a
Greek?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Alexander was not a Greek, though educated by Greek
teachers, and, as other Macedonians, using the Greek language.
Macedon was not a part of Greece, but held Greece as a dependency,
and used her power in expelling the Persians.</p>

<p class="question">Q. After the confusion of tongues and the dispersion of mankind,
into what families lingual were they divided?</p>

<p class="answer">A. Into <i>Shemetic</i>, <i>Hametic</i>, and <i>Japhetic</i>. The descendants
of Shem peopled central Asia, particularly the parts about the
Euphrates. The dialect or language called Aramaic prevailed
in their northern and northeastern territory, the Arabic in their
southern, and in their central and western the Hebrew. These
are cognate languages, and profitably studied in connection.
The descendants of Japheth spread over Europe and the northwest
of Asia. Those of Ham occupied the southern part of the
globe, particularly Africa. The languages spoken in these sections,
respectively, may also be grouped together, and, however
different, give evidence of a common origin. The general division
into the above three classes has been found convenient,
though the patronymics are used only to indicate remote origin
and kinship.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF GREECE.</h3>

<p>Instead of indicating the sounds of the vowels in the Greek and Latin
names given in the notes, we follow the plan of Webster’s Unabridged
Dictionary, giving rules for pronouncing the vowels and consonants. As
the two principal marks (¯&nbsp;͝ &nbsp;) are in Greek and Latin used differently from
what they are in English, indicating the <i>quantity</i> instead of <i>quality</i>, it will
be found less confusing to adopt this method.</p>

<h4>RULES FOR THE VOWELS.</h4>

<p>1. Any vowel at the end of an accented syllable, and <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, at the
end of an unaccented syllable, have the long English sound.</p>

<p>2. <i>A</i>, ending an unaccented syllable, has the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>, or
in <i>last</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>I</i>, ending a final syllable, has the long sound. At the end of an initial
unaccented syllable it varies between <i>i</i> long and <i>i</i> short (like <i>i</i> in <i>pin</i>).
In all other cases <i>i</i>, ending an unaccented syllable, is short.</p>

<p>4. <i>Y</i> is like <i>i</i> in the same situation.</p>

<p>5. <i>Æ</i> and <i>æ</i> like <i>e</i> in the same situation.</p>

<p>6. If a syllable end in a consonant the vowel has the short English
sound.</p>

<p>7. <i>E</i>, in final <i>es</i>, like <i>e</i> in Andes.</p>

<h4>RULES FOR CONSONANTS.</h4>

<p>1. <i>C</i>, before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>æ</i>, <i>œ</i>, is pronounced like <i>s;</i> before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, and
before consonants, like <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>G</i>, before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>æ</i>, and <i>œ</i>, or another <i>g</i> followed by <i>e</i>, has the sound
of <i>j;</i> before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>, and consonants other than <i>g</i>, the hard sound.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ch</i> is like <i>k</i>, but is silent before a mute at the beginning of a word.</p>

<p>4. Initial <i>x</i> is like <i>z</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>T</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>c</i>, before <i>ia</i>, <i>ie</i>, <i>ii</i>, <i>io</i>, <i>iv</i>, and <i>ev</i>, preceded immediately by
the accent, change into <i>sh</i> and <i>zh;</i> but when the <i>t</i> follows <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, or <i>z</i>, or
when the accent falls on the first of the vowels following, the consonant
preserves its pure sound.</p>

<p>6. Initial <i>ph</i>, before a mute, is silent.</p>

<p>P. 1—“Autonomy,” au-tŏn´o-my. The word is formed from the
Greek words for <i>law</i> and <i>self</i> and means a law unto one’s self, or self-government.</p>

<p>P. 1—“Koroneia” or Coronea, cor<b>´</b>o-ni´a.</p>

<p>P. 2—“Antalkidas,” an-tal´ci-das.</p>

<p>P. 2—“Phœbidas,” phœb´i-das. A Lacedæmonian of whom nothing
of importance is known save his part in the seizure of Thebes. Phœbidas
was slain in battle by the Thebans in 378.</p>

<p>P. 2—“Leontiades,” le-on-ti´a-des; “Ismenias,” is-me´ni-as; “Pelopidas,”
pe-lop´i-das; “Mellon,” mel´lon; “Charon,” ka´ron; “Gorgias,”

which the animal was recognized to be the god: he must be black, a

century, but now constitute one of the two leading divisions of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy. The Emperor of Austria is the King of Hungary.</p>

<p>P. 1, c. 2—“Turanians,” tu-ra´ni-ans. The tribes of the Turanians

the greatest rejoicing prevailed.</p>

<p>P. 2, c. 2—“Runes.” The Norsemen had a peculiar alphabet of sixteen
letters, or signs. It was not used as we use our alphabet; indeed,
as the word <i>rune</i> (mystery) signifies, its meaning was known to but few.
The letters were carved on rocks, stones, utensils, etc. Also, as in the
case alluded to, on smooth sticks for divination. A mysterious power
was supposed to reside in these characters.</p>

republic, Lamartine’s eloquence and boldness prevented open attack upon
the aristocracy. He occupied several positions under the new government,
but finally retired to literary work.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
